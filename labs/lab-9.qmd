We are going to try a lab that doesn't involve writing/running any code
in R! But you can still use R to answer the questions (or put things
into word if you prefer). [**Remember to knit and turn in a Word

**Objective:** This lab is designed to develop the crucial skill of
translating a behavioral science research question into an appropriate
statistical model, and vice-versa. Instead of relying on a fixed
decision tree, we will practice linking the *substance* of a question
and the *structure* of the data to the choice of an analytic method. The
goal is to foster statistical reasoning, where the model serves the
scientific inquiry.

**Instructions:** This lab has two parts. For each scenario, provide the
requested information, focusing on clear and concise justifications.
Please submit your completed lab as a single document.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Part 1: From Research Question to Statistical Model**

For each of the following scenarios, you are given a description of a
research goal, similar to what might be in an intro.

1.  Identify the most appropriate statistical model from the options we
    have covered so far (**T-test (i.e., Independent, Dependent, Single
    Sample)**, **One-Way ANOVA**, or **Simple Linear Regression**).
2.  Write a brief (2-3 sentences) justification for your choice. Your
    justification must reference:
    -   The nature of the predictor variable (e.g., categorical with two
        levels, continuous).
    -   The nature of the outcome variable.
    -   What the key research question is asking for (e.g., a mean
        difference, a predictive relationship, a linear trend).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Scenario A**

> "Previous research suggests that individuals with major depressive
> disorder (MDD) show deficits in cognitive control. However, it is
> unclear if this deficit is present in those with sub-threshold
> depressive symptoms. To address this, we recruited two independent
> groups of young adults: one group meeting formal criteria for MDD
> (n=50) and a control group with no history of psychiatric disorders
> (n=50). We hypothesized that the MDD group would show lower
> performance on the Stroop task, a measure of cognitive control,
> compared to the control group."

-   **2. Justification:**

### **Scenario B**

> "Sleep continuity is vital for well-being, yet its direct relationship
> with daily mood in non-clinical populations is not well-characterized.
> We conducted a study to examine whether the number of times a person
> wakes up during the night predicts their self-reported mood the
> following morning. We collected data from 100 university students,
> measuring their number of nocturnal awakenings via a wrist-worn device
> and their morning mood on a 100-point scale. We expect that a higher
> number of awakenings will be associated with a lower mood score."

-   **1. Statistical Model:**
-   **2. Justification:**

### **Scenario C**

> "Parental expressed emotion is a key factor in the home environment.
> We are interested in whether there are differences in academic
> achievement among adolescents from three distinct home environments,
> characterized by low, moderate, or high levels of expressed parental
> criticism. We categorized 150 adolescents into one of these three
> groups based on a structured family interview and obtained their grade
> point average (GPA) for the academic year."

-   **1. Statistical Model:**
-   **2. Justification:**

### **Scenario D**

> "A core symptom of social anxiety disorder is the avoidance of social
> situations. To test a new intervention, we conducted a randomized
> controlled trial where participants were assigned to either a 12-week
> mindfulness-based therapy group or a psychoeducation control group. At
> the end of the trial, we measured the number of social events each
> participant attended in the final week. We hypothesize that the
> mindfulness group will attend a greater number of social events on
> average than the control group."

-   **1. Statistical Model:**
-   **2. Justification:**

### **Scenario E**

> "It is well-established that age is related to cognitive function, but
> the specific trajectory is of interest. To explore this, we gathered a
> cross-sectional sample of 200 adults ranging from age 20 to 80. Each
> participant completed a standardized test of working memory. Our
> primary goal is to model the linear relationship between a person's
> age and their working memory score to understand the rate of change
> across the lifespan."

-   **1. Statistical Model:**
-   **2. Justification:**

### **Scenario F**

> "Chronic stress during adolescence can impact physiological
> regulation. We are interested in whether adolescents who report
> experiencing high, medium, or low levels of chronic life stress show
> differences in their morning cortisol levels, a key biomarker of the
> stress response system. We collected saliva samples from 90
> adolescents who were categorized into one of the three stress groups
> based on a validated questionnaire."

## **Part 2: From Statistical Model to Research Question**

For each of the following scenarios, you are given the statistical
output and a brief description of the variables.

1.  Infer and write out the specific research question that this
    analysis was likely designed to answer.
2.  Explain which parts of the output led you to your conclusion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Scenario G**

-   **Data Description:** A dataset includes `bdi_score` (Beck
    Depression Inventory score, continuous) and `sleep_hours` (average
    hours of sleep per night, continuous).
-   **Statistical Output:**

``` r
Call:
lm(formula = bdi_score ~ sleep_hours, data = df)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)  sleep_hours
     35.50        -2.50
```

### **Scenario H**

-   **Data Description:** A dataset includes `anxiety_score` (a
    continuous measure of anxiety) and `treatment_group` (a categorical
    variable with two levels: "CBT" and "Waitlist").
-   **Statistical Output:**

``` r

    `procrastination_index` (a continuous score based on a behavioral
    task).

lm(formula = procrastination_index ~ perfectionism_score, data = df)
