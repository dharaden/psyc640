## Instructions

Welcome to your first lab! The goal of this assignment is to move beyond
basic syntax and begin practicing a reproducible data analysis workflow.

Please complete the exercises below. Create a new `.Rmd` file and
include the following at the top:

``` r
---
title: "Lab 1: Foundations of a Data Workflow"
author: "Your Name Here"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: html_document
editor_options: 
  chunk_output_type: console
  markdown: 
    wrap: 72
---
```

You should then be able to copy/paste everything below into your
document.

When you are finished, click the **Knit** button to turn your work into
an HTML document. You will submit both this `.Rmd` file and the final
`.html` file.

### Exercise 1: Loading Packages & Exploring Data

A major strength of R is its ecosystem of packages that add new
functionality. We will use the `tidyverse` package in almost every
analysis we do. The `ggplot2` package, which is part of the `tidyverse`,
contains a dataset called `msleep` about mammal sleep patterns.

``` r
# Task 1: Load the tidyverse package.
# Write your code here:


# Task 2: The `msleep` dataset is available after loading the tidyverse.
# Use the `glimpse()` function to get a quick overview of the `msleep` dataset.
# Write your code here:


# Task 3: Now use the `summary()` function on the `msleep` dataset.
# Write your code here:
```

**❓Question 1:** Based on the output of `glimpse()`, how many rows
(observations) and columns (variables) are in the `msleep` dataset?

**Your Answer:** \[Type your answer here\]

**❓Question 2:** What is one key difference between the information
provided by `glimpse()` and the information provided by `summary()` for
a variable like `sleep_total`?

**Your Answer:** \[Type your answer here\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercise 2: Data Wrangling

Let's say we are only interested in herbivores. We can use functions
from the `dplyr` package (part of the `tidyverse`) to create a new,
sorted dataset.

``` r
# Task 1: Create a new object called `herbivores` that contains only the animals
# from the `msleep` dataset where the `vore` column is equal to "herbi".
# Hint: The syntax for filtering is: new_object <- old_object %>% filter(column_name == "value")
# Write your code here:


# Task 2: Now, sort this new `herbivores` dataset by total sleep time, from highest to lowest.
# You can overwrite the `herbivores` object with the newly sorted version.
# Hint: Use the `arrange()` function with `desc()` for descending order.
# The syntax is: object <- object %>% arrange(desc(column_to_sort_by))
# Write your code here:


# Now, print the new, sorted `herbivores` object to see the result.

```

**❓Question:** After sorting, which herbivore sleeps the most? How many
hours does it sleep?

**Your Answer:** \[Type your answer here\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercise 3: First Data Visualization

Data visualization is a critical part of understanding data. Let's
create a scatterplot to see if there is a relationship between how long
a herbivore sleeps and how much time it spends dreaming.

``` r
# Task: Create a scatterplot using ggplot().
# We want to plot the `sleep_rem` (dreaming sleep) on the y-axis and `sleep_total` on the x-axis,
# using only our `herbivores` dataset.
# Fill in the blanks in the code below.

ggplot(data = ________, aes(x = _______, y = _________)) +
  geom_????? +
  labs(title = "Total Sleep vs. REM Sleep in Herbivores",
       x = "Total Sleep (hours)",
       y = "REM Sleep (hours)")
```

**❓Question 1:** Look at the plot you created. In one or two sentences,
describe the relationship you see between total sleep and REM sleep for
these animals. Is the relationship positive, negative, or is there no
clear relationship?

**Your Answer:** \[Type your answer here\]

**❓Question 2:** Are there any animals that seem unusual or stand out
from the general pattern? Briefly describe one.

**Your Answer:** \[Type your answer here\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercise 4: Calculating Summary Statistics

Often, we want to calculate a single value to summarize our data. The
`summarise()` function is perfect for this.

``` r
# Task: Calculate the average (mean) total sleep time for ALL mammals in the original `msleep` dataset.
# Hint: The syntax is: dataset %>% summarise(new_variable_name = mean(column_name, na.rm = TRUE))
# The `na.rm = TRUE` part is important because it tells R to ignore any missing values.
# Write your code here:
```

**❓Question:** What is the mean total sleep time for all mammals in the
dataset?

**Your Answer:** \[Type your answer here\]
