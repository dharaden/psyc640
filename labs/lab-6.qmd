## Scenario and Goal

Welcome back! For this lab you'll step into the role of a data analyst
for a clinical psychology lab. Your team has just completed a pilot
randomized controlled trial (RCT) for a new, brief CBT (Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy) intervention designed to reduce symptoms of
depression (`group` variable). You've been given the initial dataset and
tasked with running the primary analyses to see if the intervention
shows promise.

This dataset includes participant demographics (`sex`, `age`) and
depression scores from before (`bdi_pre`) and after (`bdi_post`) the
trial. As is common in clinical research, some participants dropped out
before the final assessment, resulting in **missing data**.

::: callout-note
The BDI is a common measure to assess for symptoms of depression. It
stands for the Beck Depression Inventory and higher scores indicate a
higher level of depression.

## Exercises

### **Task 1: Setup & Data Inspection (10 points)**

Your first and most important task is always to understand and inspect
your data before running any analyses.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create a new R Markdown file** named `Week6_Lab.Rmd`.

2.  **Load Libraries and Data**

3.  **Initial Inspection:**

    -   Use `glimpse()` to see the structure of your data.

    -   Use `summary()` to get a quick overview of each variable. **Pay
        close attention to the `bdi_post` variable.** What do you
        notice?

4.  **Visualization:**

    -   Generate a visualization of the distribution for bdi_pre and
        bdi_post

        -   These can be two separate figures

5.  **Summary Stats (2 tables)**:

    -   Provide descriptive statistics (Means & SD) in a nice looking
        table for age, bdi_pre, bdi_post. Include a correlation table
        with those variables as well.

### **Task 2: Paired-Samples t-test - Did the Individual CBT Work?** 

For participants who received one-on-one therapy
(`group == "Individual CBT"`), did their depression scores significantly
decrease?

1.  **Filter the data:** Create a new data frame called `individual_tx`
    that contains *only* the participants from the `Individual CBT`
    group.

2.  **Run the test:** Conduct a **paired-samples t-test** on the
    `bdi_pre` and `bdi_post` scores within the `individual_tx` data.

3.  **Interpret the results:** Based on the results, was there a
    statistically significant change in BDI scores? Describe the
    direction and magnitude of the change.

### **Task 3: One-Sample t-test - Achieving Clinical Remission**

A BDI score below 10 is often considered the cutoff for clinical
remission. Did our individual CBT group, on average, get below this
threshold?

1.  **Run the test:** Using the `individual_tx` data, conduct a
    **one-sample t-test** on the `bdi_post` scores, testing against a
    population mean (`mu`) of 10.

2.  **APA Write-up:** Report your results in a full APA-formatted
    sentence. You will need to calculate the mean and standard deviation
    for the `bdi_post` scores separately to include in your write-up.

### **Task 4: One-Way ANOVA**

Now we'll compare the final outcomes (`bdi_post`) across all three
groups: Individual CBT, Group CBT, and the Waitlist Control.

1.  **Run the ANOVA:** Using the full `cbt_data`, conduct a one-way
    ANOVA to test for differences in `bdi_post` among the three `group`
    conditions.

2.  **Interpret the ANOVA:** Look at the `summary()` of your ANOVA
    object. Is the overall F-test significant? What does this tell us?
    Note the degrees of freedom—does the sample size make sense given
    the data?

3.  **Run Post-Hoc Tests:** A significant ANOVA requires a post-hoc
    test. Run a **Tukey HSD** test to see which specific groups differ.

4.  **Write a conclusion:** In 2-3 sentences, summarize the findings
    from the post-hoc test. Which treatment(s) were effective compared
    to the control group?

### **Task 5: Independent-Samples t-test - Exploring Sex as a Moderator** 

We were also interested to use exploratory analyses to further
understand the impact of the treatment. For instance, did the therapy
work equally well for males and females? Let's investigate this.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Calculate change scores:** Create a new data frame called
    `cbt_active_tx` that contains only the two **active therapy groups**
    (Individual and Group CBT). Add a new column to it called
    `bdi_change`, calculated as `bdi_pre - bdi_post`.

2.  **Run the test:** In this `cbt_active_tx` data, conduct an
    **independent-samples t-test** to see if there is a significant
    difference in the `bdi_change` scores between participants
    identified as `Male` and `Female`.

3.  **Visualize and Interpret:** Create a `ggplot` boxplot to visualize
    the `bdi_change` scores by `sex`. Based on your test and your plot,
    is there any evidence that the treatment effect was different for
    males versus females in this pilot study?
