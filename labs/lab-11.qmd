YET -from: past dr. haraden

## **Objective:**

This lab focuses on connecting what we have learned in class to the peer
reviewed articles that you may be reading.

## **Instructions:**

Identify articles in the scientific literature that perform quantitative
analyses (no reviews or meta-analyses).

Find [2 articles]{.underline}: one that includes a ***t-test*** and
another that includes ***multiple regression***.

In your document, I would like to see:

-   The article citations and a designation of whether it is the t-test
    or multiple regression

-   The extracted text from the article that describes the test they are
    performing (not necessarily just the results, but their
    justification).

-   The articles main research question

-   How the analysis (t-test or multiple regression) adds to the
    "answer" for the main research question

-   Reflection on how challenging/easy finding each test was

## Submission:

Please submit a document (Word or Google Doc) that includes the
information above, as well as the PDFs of the 2 research papers that you
identified.
