## Instructions

The goal of the final project is to apply your knowledge of data
analysis skills that we have learned in this course. You will begin by
having a research question that you will attempt to answer with an open
dataset. Then you will highlight the process, and report the appropriate
analyses. All information should be self-contained and 100% reproducible
with the file/folder that you have uploaded.

### General Overview

We will be breaking the final project up into sections to help structure
the data analytic process.

**Part 1 (Due 11/16):** Identify 5 datasets that you could work with for
the final project

-   These *cannot* be data that we have used in class before

-   Data can be from your mentor/lab, but *cannot* be directly used for
    your thesis (I just don't want a 1 to 1 copy from this to your
    thesis)

**Part 2 (Due 11/23):** Narrow down the datasets and generate a testable
research question/hypothesis

-   This should also include the analyses that you would like to perform

**Part 3 (Due 12/08):** Share your data and analyses in a brief
presentation to the group

-   You will also submit a written report that includes your data
    analytic plan and the results.

### **General**

-   **Create an R Markdown File:** All your work should be done in a
    single R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file. Name your file
    `LastName_FirstName_Midterm.Rmd`.
    -   This file will include your code as well as your written
        responses. This should look close to a results section with the
        code in between.
    -   Provide comments within the code chunks to highlight the main
        goal of each of the functions or set of information that you are
        doing. This helps with organization since the reset of the text
        outside of the code chunks will be for writing the results.
-   **Submission:** You will submit both your `.Rmd` file and the
    knitted PDF or HTML document.

## **Project Steps**

#### **Part 1: Setup and Data Import**

Your first step is to set up your R Markdown document and load the data.

1.  **Load Libraries:** At the top of your R Markdown script, load all
    the necessary libraries. You don't have to know every single library
    to use here. Just be sure to add them to this section as you are
    going through your code.
2.  **Load the Data:** Use the appropriate function (e.g.,
    `read_csv()`). Be sure that this is easily reproducible on another
    computer.

#### **Part 2: Data Cleaning and Scoring**

Real-world data is often messy. In this part, you will wrangle the data
and create new variables needed for your analysis.

1.  **Scoring the ARS-SF (Anxiety Resilience Scale - Short Form):** We
    need to first reverse score Item #6. Then we can create two
    subscales:
    1.  Anxiety Subscale - Calculate the mean of Items 1, 2 & 3.
    2.  Resilience Subscale - Calculate the mean of Items 4, 5 &
        6(reversed).
2.  **Recoding Variables:** Create a new, cleanly labeled factor
    variable for any grouping variable (see example code below on how to
    do this). Recode the numeric values (e.g., 1s and 2s) to meaningful
    labels (e.g., "Male" and "Female").

``` r
# Recode the grouping variable into a factor with clear labels
analytic_data <- analytic_data %>%
  mutate(
    [FACTOR_VARIABLE_NAME] = factor([ORIGINAL_VARIABLE],
                                  levels = c(1, 2),
                                  labels = c("Group 1 Label", "Group 2 Label"))
  )
```

#### **Part 3: Descriptive Statistics**

Now that you have clean data, let's describe it.

1.  **Continuous variabels:** Get descriptive statistics (mean, sd,
    median, range) for the continuous variables (Note: when reporting
    the ARS-SF, just use the subscale scores).
2.  **Frequencies:** Use `table()` or `count()` to get the frequency
    distribution for the categorical variables.
3.  **Write-up:** Write a brief paragraph summarizing the descriptive
    statistics. Report the mean and standard deviation for continuous
    variables and the counts and percentages for categorical variables.
    1.  For this write-up, focus on the age, sex, group and well-being
        variables. Include all variables in a table.

*Example: "The sample consisted of N = 143 participants (22% female)
with an average age of 102.3 (SD = .03). 45% of the sample were
students..."*

#### **Part 4: Correlation Analysis**

Next, examine the associations between the continuous variables.

1.  **Create a Correlation Matrix:** Generate a table of the
    correlations (hint: use sjPlot). Be sure to include a title and have
    the labels make sense.
2.  **Write-up:** Report the results in APA style. Describe the
    direction, strength, and statistical significance of the correlation
    between the Anxiety score and General Well Being.

#### **Part 5: Group Differences**

Test for differences in your outcome variable across the three groups.

1.  **Run the t-test or ANOVA:** Test if the General Well-being score
    differs significantly across the levels of group. Conduct any
    follow-up/post-hoc analyses if necessary.

2.  **Visualize the Difference:** Create a plot showing the distribution
    of outcome for each of the groups.

3.  **Write-up:** Report the results in APA style. State whether there
    was a significant effect of the grouping variable on the outcome.
    Report follow-up/post-hoc analyses if necessary.

#### **Part 6: Regression Analysis**

Finally, build a simple linear regression model to predict the General
Well-being outcome. Select one predictor variable that you want to
investigate.

1.  **Fit the Model:** Use the `lm()` function to fit a regression
    model.
2.  **View the Summary:** Use `summary()` to get the detailed results of
    your model.
3.  **Visualize the Model:** Create a scatter plot (`ggplot`) showing
    the relationship between the variables (be sure to include a fit
    line, titles and nice axis labels)
4.  **Write-up:** Write a paragraph summarizing the regression results
    in APA style. Report the overall model fit (R-squared and
    F-statistic) and the coefficients for the predictor, noting the
    statistical significance.

***Nice work! Don't forget to 🧶knit the document to submit!***
