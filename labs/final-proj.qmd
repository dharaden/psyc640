## Instructions

The goal of the final project is to apply your knowledge of data
analysis skills that we have learned in this course. You will begin by
having a research question that you will attempt to answer with an open
dataset. Then you will highlight the process, and report the appropriate
analyses. All information should be self-contained and 100% reproducible
with the file/folder that you have uploaded.

### General Overview

We will be breaking the final project up into sections to help structure
the data analytic process.

**Part 1 (Due 11/16):** Identify 5 datasets that you could work with for
the final project

-   These *cannot* be data that we have used in class before

-   Data can be from your mentor/lab, but *cannot* be directly used for
    your thesis (I just don't want a 1 to 1 copy from this to your
    thesis)

**Part 2 (Due 11/23):** Narrow down the datasets and generate a testable
research question/hypothesis

-   This should also include the analyses that you would like to perform

**Part 3 (Due 12/08):** Share your data and analyses in a brief
presentation to the group

-   You will also submit a written report that includes your data
    analytic plan and the results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Project Steps

## Part 1 (Due 11/16)

For the first part of your final project, you will need to identify five
potential datasets that you could use to answer a research question.
These datasets cannot be ones that we have used in class previously.
While you may use data from your mentor or lab, the project you submit
for this course cannot be a direct copy of your thesis work.

​When searching for datasets, consider the following resources:

-   **Open Access Repositories**: There are several online repositories
    that house freely accessible datasets. Some of these that are
    specific to psychology include PsychArchives and PsyArXiv. The Open
    Science Framework (OSF) is another excellent resource for finding
    datasets across various disciplines, including psychology.​

<!-- -->

-   **University and Government-Funded Collections**: Many universities
    and government agencies maintain data repositories. The
    Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research
    (ICPSR), sponsored by the University of Michigan, is a large archive
    of social and behavioral science data. The U.S. government also has
    many open datasets on topics like education and substance abuse that
    can be useful for psychological research.

-   <https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets>

-   <https://guides.library.unt.edu/health-data-analytics/open-datasets>

**Document Submission:** Please submit a document that has the following
information for each dataset:

-   Source of data (include links)

-   Brief description (2-3 sentences) of the data (i.e., what is it
    measuring)

-   Sample Size

-   Brief rationale for why you think it would be a good choice for this
    project (3-5 sentences)

## Part 2 (Due 11/23)

For the second part of the project, you will select one of the five
datasets you identified in Part 1 and develop a testable research
question/hypothesis. Your research question should be specific and able
to be answered using the data in your chosen dataset.

​Your proposal for Part 2 should include the following sections:

-   **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the dataset you have chosen and
    the general topic you will be investigating. Be sure to include 3+
    citations to support your investigation

<!-- -->

-   **Research Question and Hypothesis**: State your research question
    clearly and concisely. If applicable, formulate a specific, testable
    hypothesis that you will evaluate with your data analysis.

-   **Proposed Analyses**: Describe the statistical analyses you plan to
    use to test your hypothesis/research question

::: callout-note
If your selected dataset has greater than 400 participants, you will
need to create a random subset that has N = 400 for your analyses
:::

## Part 3 (Due 12/8 - In Class)​ 

The final part of the project consists of a brief presentation to the
class and a written report of your data analysis plan and results.

### **Presentation**​

Your presentation should be a brief overview of your project. It should
be well-organized and engaging. This can take the form of a slideshow (5
slides maximum), or any other way that you would like to convey your
message. Be sure to include the following:

-   **Introduction**: Briefly introduce your research question and why
    it is important.

<!-- -->

-   **Methods**: Describe the dataset you used and the statistical
    analyses you performed.

-   **Results**: Present your main findings, using graphs and tables to
    help illustrate your results.

-   **Discussion**: Interpret your results and discuss their
    implications.

### **Written Report**

::: callout-important
12 point font, 1 inch margins, double-spaced, XX page minimum (excluding
tables, figures, references and anything else that isn't your writing),
XX page maximum
:::

Your written report should be a comprehensive summary of your project.
It should be well-structured and include the following sections:

-   ​**Introduction**: Provide an overview of your research problem and
    state your research question and hypothesis. Include 3+ citations

-   ​**Methods**: Detail the data you used, including its source and any
    cleaning or preparation steps you took. You should also describe the
    statistical methods you used in enough detail that another
    researcher could replicate your analyses.

-   ​**Results**: Present the results of your analyses in a clear and
    organized manner. Use tables and figures (APA formatting or whatever
    field is relevant) to display your results, and be sure to include
    relevant statistical information (e.g., p-values, confidence
    intervals, effect sizes).

-   **Discussion**: Interpret your findings in the context of your
    research question. Discuss the limitations of your study and suggest
    directions for future research.

-   ​**Conclusion**: Briefly summarize your main findings and their
    significance.

Your final submission should be a single folder that is 100%
reproducible, meaning that all of your data and code should be included
and organized in a way that someone else could easily re-run your
analyses.
