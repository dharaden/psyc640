## Instructions

Answer the questions below:

1.  **High correlation, good or bad?** Two friends, Frances and Annika,
    are in disagreement about whether high correlation values are
    *always* good in the context of regression. Frances claims that it’s
    desirable for all variables in the dataset to be highly correlated
    to each other when building linear models. Annika claims that while
    it’s desirable for each of the predictors to be highly correlated
    with the outcome, it is not desirable for the predictors to be
    highly correlated with each other. Who is right: Frances, Annika,
    both, or neither? Explain your reasoning using appropriate
    terminology.

2.  Meat consumption and life expectancy. In data collected for You et
    al. (2022), total meat intake is associated with life expectancy (at
    birth) in 175 countries. Meat intake is measured in kg per capita
    per year (averaged over 2011 to 2013). The scatterplot on the top
    left displays the relationship between life expectancy at birth vs.
    per capita meat consumption. The scatterplot on the top right
    displays the same relationship colored by income status of the
    country. The set of scatterplots across the bottom display the same
    relationship by income status of the country.

a.  Describe the relationship between meat consumption and life
    expectancy.
b.  Why do you think the variables are positively associated?
c.  Is the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy
    stronger, similar, or weaker when broken down by income bracket in
    the separate plots along the bottom (as compared with the
    relationship when combined in the top left figure)?

3.  Baby weights and smoking. US Department of Health and Human
    Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect
    information on births recorded in the country. The data used here
    are a random sample of 1,000 births from 2014. Here, we study the
    relationship between smoking and weight of the baby. The variable
    smoke is coded 1 if the mother is a smoker, and 0 if not. The
    summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model
    for predicting the average birth weight of babies, measured in
    pounds, based on the smoking status of the mother.

a.  Write the equation of the regression model.

b.  Interpret the slope in this context, and calculate the predicted
    birth weight of babies born to smoker and non-smoker mothers.

4.  Movie returns, prediction. A model was fit to predict
    return-on-investment (ROI) on movies based on release year and genre
    (Adventure, Action, Drama, Horror, and Comedy). The model output is
    shown below.

![](images/clipboard-3201644716.png)

a.  For a given release year, which genre of movies are predicted, on
    average, to have the highest predicted return on investment?
b.  The adjusted $R^2$ of this model is 10.71%. Adding the production
    budget of the movie to the model increases the adjusted $R^2$ to
    10.84%. Should production budget be added to the model? Why or Why
    not?
