ðŸ§¶knitted `.html` file.

## Scenario and Data

A researcher at the university's sleep center is interested in the
factors that affect daytime sleepiness and attention in college
students. They collected survey data from a sample of students.

The data highlighted above contains the following variables:

-   **`ESS1 - ESS8`**: (Continuous) The student's responses to each item
    on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, a measure of general daytime
    sleepiness. Higher scores indicate greater sleepiness. **NOTE:** You
    will need to calculate a total score which is a sum of all 8 items.

-   **`ashs1 - ashs33`**: (Continuous) The student's responses to each
    item on the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale. Higher scores indicate
    better sleep habits (e.g., consistent bedtime, quiet environment).
    **NOTE:** You will need to reverse score all items *except*Â #27. You
    will also need to calculate a total mean score with these items.

-   **`attention1 - attention5`**: (Categorical) An indication of
    whether they passed (1) or failed (0) the attention check item. A
    proxy for their attention during the survey. **NOTE:** Calculate a
    total attention score as a sum of all 5 items.

-   **`age`**: (Continuous) The student's age in years.

-   **`gender`**: (Categorical) The student's self-reported gender
    ("Man", "Woman").

-   **`roommate`**: (Categorical) Whether the student has a roommate or
    not ("Yes", "No").

# Instructions

1.  Create a new R Markdown file for your submission. Make sure it is
    well-organized and includes your code, output, and written answers.

2.  Load the appropriate libraries and the `student_sleep_data.csv`
    dataset.

3.  Complete the tasks below.

## Task 1: Compute scores for scales

Be sure to compute the appropriate total scores for the ESS, ASHS and
Attention variables.

Once completed, only include students who have "passed" the attention
check (i.e., having a score of 4 or higher on the attention sum total).

*hint: use dplyr and filter*

## Task 2: Roommates and Daytime Sleepiness (A Group Comparison)

**The Research Question:** "Do students who have a roommate report
different levels of daytime sleepiness compared to students who do not
have a roommate?"

**Your Steps:**

1.  **Identify & Model:**

    -   What is the predictor (IV) and what is the outcome (DV)?

    -   Are they categorical or continuous?

    -   Based on this, what is the appropriate model family? Write out
        the model in R formula syntax (`outcome ~ predictor`).

2.  **Describe & Visualize:**

    -   Calculate the mean and standard deviation of `ess_score` for
        both groups (those with and without a roommate).

    -   Create a boxplot to visualize the distribution of `ess_score`
        for each group. Make sure your plot is clearly labeled.

3.  **Analyze:**

    -   Run the appropriate statistical test in R to determine if there
        is a significant difference between the groups.

4.  **Interpret & Conclude:**

    -   What is the p-value from your test?

    -   Based on the test and your descriptive statistics, write a
        one-sentence conclusion that directly answers the research
        question.

    -   **Critical Thinking:** This is an observational study. Can you
        conclude that having a roommate *causes* a change in sleepiness?
        Why or why not?

## Task 3: Sleep Habits and Age (An Association)

**The Research Question:** "Is there an association between a student's
sleep habits and their age?"

**Your Steps:**

1.  **Identify & Model:**

    -   What is the predictor (IV) and what is the outcome (DV)?

    -   Are they categorical or continuous?

    -   Based on this, what is the appropriate model family? Write out
        the model in R formula syntax.

2.  **Visualize:**

    -   Create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between
        `ashs_score` (sleep habits) and `age`.

    -   Add a line of best fit to the plot. Make sure your plot is
        clearly labeled.

3.  **Analyze:**

    -   Run the appropriate statistical test in R to determine if there
        is a significant association between the two variables.

4.  **Interpret & Conclude:**

    -   What is the correlation coefficient (`r`) and the p-value from
        your test?

    -   Based on these results, write a one-sentence conclusion that
        describes the nature and significance of the relationship.
