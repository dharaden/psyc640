## Instructions

We are going to investigate what is most highly related to the number of
Spotify streams in this Popular Music dataset. This data was taken from:
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmadrazakashif/spotify-popularity-songs>

Here are the things that you will need for this lab:

-   <a href="/files/data/popular_spotify.csv" download="popular_spotify.csv">Download
    Spotify Data (.csv)</a>
-   <a href="/files/_lab-rmd/lab-5_cor.Rmd" download="lab-5_cor.Rmd">Download
    Lab 5 (.Rmd)</a>

When you are finished, click the **Knit** button to turn your work into
an HTML document. You will submit both this `.Rmd` file and the
ðŸ§¶knitted `.html` file.

## Scenario and Goal

We have been asked by an up and coming music artist to use our advanced
data analytic skills to see what has been related to the most popular
songs. They have provided us with all of this data for recent popular
songs that have been streamed the most.

Our goal is to identify which variable is most related to higher
streams. These variables that they are looking at are things like
danceability, instrumentalness, etc.

### Variables of Interest

-   `streams`: The number of streams for the individual song

-   Percentage Variables: These variables reflect a rating from 0-100 on
    the intensity related to that variable

    -   `danceability_%`
    -   `valence_%`
    -   `energy_%`
    -   `acousticness_%`
    -   `instrumentalness_%`
    -   `liveness_%`
    -   `speechiness_%`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lab Exercises

Import your data and use the `clean_names()` function to make the
variables a little nicer looking

Start by creating a correlation table (make sure it looks nice and not
just an output from R using `cor()`).

Examine the correlation table and identify the two largest effects with
the outcome (`streams`).

Visualize the two correlations that you have identified.

Choose one of the relationships that you visualized and write the
results in APA format.
