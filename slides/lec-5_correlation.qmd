How A Simple Experiment Paved the Way for Modern Experimental Design 📊

Taken from [Tweet](https://x.com/selcukorkmaz/status/1690348343363334144){target="_blank"} by Selçuk Korkmaz

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setting:

In 1925, during a summer afternoon on campus, a lady, Dr. Muriel Bristol ([who has an algae species named after her](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydomonas)), was handed a cup of tea by Ronald Fisher. She declined saying:

*"I prefer the flavor when the milk is poured first. I can tell when there is a difference"*

Fisher, being a statistician and a white man:

*"Prove it"*

::: callout-note
*Sometimes, groundbreaking insights arise from everyday claims!*
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Designing the Test:

Fisher prepared 8 cups of tea; 4 with milk first & 4 with tea first

Dr. Muriel Bristol *correctly* identified 3 out of 4 of each! (some reports claim she identified all correctly)

*Was it just chance or genuine ability?*

::: callout-note
Always consider both outcomes. In hypothesis testing, this means setting up null and alternative hypotheses.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Birth of Hypothesis Testing:

Fisher framed it as a combinatorial problem

If it was mere luck/chance, the *probability* of getting all 8 correct was low

This way of thinking is the groundwork for the concept of the p-value

::: callout-important
The p-value gives the probability of observing data (or something more extreme) given that the null hypothesis is true.
:::

# NHST

The core idea of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is a bit backward, but powerful:

> We can't prove our research hypothesis is true. Instead, we gather evidence to show that the alternative explanation (the null hypothesis) is incredibly unlikely

It's a process of elimination and inference

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Tortured Logic of NHST

We create two hypotheses, $H_0$ and $H_1$. Usually, we care about $H_1$, not $H_0$. In fact, what we really want to know is how likely $H_1$, given our data.

$$P(H_1|Data)$$ Instead, we're going to test our null hypothesis. Well, not really. We're going to assume our null hypothesis is true, and test how likely we would be to get these data.

$$P(Data|H_0)$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## NHST Analogy: The Legal System

-   The **Null Hypothesis (** $H_0$ **)** is the starting assumption: "**presumed innocent**." In research, this means assuming there is *no effect*, *no relationship*, or *no difference*.

-   **You, the researcher**, are the prosecution, gathering evidence (data) to challenge this presumption.

-   Your **p-value** reflects the strength of your evidence. A small p-value *likely* means your evidence is strong.

-   **Rejecting the null** is like a "guilty" verdict. You have enough evidence to say the initial presumption of innocence (no effect) is unlikely to be true.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## p-value: Formal Definition

This is one of the most important—and misunderstood—concepts in statistics.

The **p-value** is:

> The probability of observing a result **as extreme as, or more extreme than**, the one we actually observed, **assuming the null hypothesis is true.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## p-value: Formal Definition

This is one of the most important—and misunderstood—concepts in statistics.

**It is NOT:**

-   The probability that the null hypothesis is true

-   The probability that our research hypothesis is true

-   A measure of the size or importance of an effect

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What are the steps of NHST?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  Define null and alternative hypothesis.

2.  Set and justify alpha level (usually $\alpha$ = .05)

3.  Determine which sampling distribution ( $z$, $t$, or $\chi^2$ for now)

4.  Calculate parameters of your sampling distribution under the null.

-   If $z$, calculate $\mu$ and $\sigma_M$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
5.  Calculate test statistic under the null.

-   If $z$, $\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma_M}$

6.  Calculate probability of that test statistic or more extreme under the null, and compare to alpha.

## 🧠 Think about...

> You run a correlational analysis to see if levels of anxiety are related to caffeine consumption. You get a correlation of 0.38 and a p-value of *p =* .045.

Turn to someone next to you and in your own words, explain what the p-value is telling you.

-   Looking at the p-value, what can you conclude?

-   Looking at the p-value, what can't you conclude?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠More thinking...

What if you ran the same study and analyses, but found that your p-value was *p =* .052?

# The "How" - Pearson's Correlation ($r$)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is a Correlation?

A statistical expression that quantifies the extent to which two continuous variables are linearly related

**Association - Correlation**

Will tell us 2 key pieces of information about the relationship:

1.  Direction (Positive vs. Negative)
2.  Strength (Magnitude from 0 to 1)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Candy & \# of Houses

**Research Question:** Is there a relationship between the amount of candy we receive on Halloween and the \# of houses that we go to?

-   **Variables:**

    -   `house_n`: Number of houses approached

    -   `candy`: Amount of candy (# of pieces)

-   **Hypothesis** $H_A$ : There will be a **positive correlation**. As a trick-or-treater goes to more houses, their amount of candy will increase ( $r \neq 0$ .

-   **Null Hypothesis** $H_0$: There is **no correlation** ( $r = 0$ ).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1: ALWAYS visualize data

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

set.seed(42)

n <- 200
house_n <- rnorm(n, mean = 10, sd = 2)
candy <- 2 * house_n + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 2) 
corr_data <- data.frame(house_n, candy)

corr_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(house_n, candy)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 2, color = "purple") + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", 
              se = FALSE, 
              color = "orange") + 
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Num. of Houses and Amount of Candy on Halloween",
    x = "Number of Houses", 
    y = "Amount of Candy"
  ) + 
  theme_grey(paper = "black",
        ink = "white",)


```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Association - Covariance

Before we talk about correlation, we need to take a look at covariance

$$
cov_{xy} = \frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}{N-1}
$$

::: incremental
-   Covariance can be thought of as the "average cross product" between two variables

-   It captures the *raw/unstandardized* relationship between two variables

-   Covariance matrix is the basis for many statistical analyses
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Covariance to Correlation

The Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ addresses this by standardizing the covariance

It is done in the same way that we would create a $z-score$...by dividing by the standard deviation

$$
r_{xy} = \frac{Cov(x,y)}{sd_x sd_y}
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pearson's $r$

**Range:** Varies from -1 (perfect negative correlation) and +1 (perfect positive correlation)

**Assumptions:**

1.  **Continuous Variables:** Both variables are measured on an interval or ratio scale.

2.  **Linearity:** The relationship between the variables is linear. (This is why you **must** visualize your data!)

3.  **Bivariate Normality:** Data points are normally distributed for both variables. (Pearson's $r$ is fairly robust to minor violations).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Interpreting Correlations ([5.7.5](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/descriptives.html#interpretingcorrelations))

| Correlation  |  Strength   | Direction |
|:------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
| -1.0 to -0.9 | Very Strong | Negative  |
| -0.9 to -0.7 |   Strong    | Negative  |
| -0.7 to -0.4 |  Moderate   | Negative  |
| -0.4 to -0.2 |    Weak     | Negative  |
|  -0.2 to 0   | Negligible  | Negative  |
|   0 to 0.2   | Negligible  | Positive  |
|  0.2 to 0.4  |    Weak     | Positive  |
|  0.4 to 0.7  |  Moderate   | Positive  |
|  0.7 to 0.9  |   Strong    | Positive  |
|  0.9 to 1.0  | Very Strong | Positive  |

# Pearson Correlations in R

## Calculating Correlation in R

Now how do we get a correlation value in R?

```{r}
cor(corr_data$house_n, corr_data$candy)

```

That will give us the correlation, but we also want to know how to get our p-value

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Correlation Test

To get the test of a single pair of variables, we will use the `cor.test()` function:

```{r}
cor.test(corr_data$house_n, corr_data$candy)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Components of `cor.test()`

-   **`p-value`**: The probability of getting a correlation this strong if the null were true is virtually zero ( $p < .001$ ) . We **reject the null hypothesis**.

-   **`95 percent confidence interval`**: We are 95% confident that the true population correlation is between 0.86 and 0.92. Importantly, this interval **does not contain 0**.

    -   We cannot say "There is a 95% chance that the population correlation falls in this range"

    -   CI's are based on the infinite running of the test (<https://rpsychologist.com/d3/ci/>)

-   **`sample estimates: cor`**: This is our sample correlation coefficient, $r = 0.89$. This is our **effect size**.

# The "So What?" - Effect Sizes & Practical Significance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Significance

The $p-value$ gives us the *statistical significance*. It will tell us that the effect we identified is **likely not to be 0**

It does not tell us *anything* about how large or meaningful the effect actually is. This is where the **effect size** comes in!

::: callout-important
With a large enough sample size, even a tiny, trivial correlation (e.g., r \< 0.1) can become statistically significant. [Think about what happens to sampling distribution when sample size increases.](https://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/){target="_blank"}
:::

**Statistical Significance** $\neq$ **Practical Significance**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Effect Sizes: Correlation

For correlation, we have two related measures of effect size:

1.  **Pearson's** $r$: The correlation coefficient itself. A standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear association.

    -   Cohen's Conventions (a rough guide): Small (∣.10∣), Medium (∣.30∣), Large (∣.50∣).

    -   Our finding of $r = 0.89$ is a **large effect**.

2.  **Coefficient of Determination** ($R^2$): This is simply r squared. It represents the **proportion of variance** in one variable that is "explained" or "accounted for" by the other.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Putting it Together

For our candy and housese data:

-   Our correlation was $r = 0.89$

-   The coefficient of determination is $R^2 = 0.89^2 = 0.792$

**Interpretation:**

> **"Approximately 79% of the variance in the amount of candy that one gets on Halloween can be accounted for by the number of houses they go to."**

This is a powerful and practical statement about the strength of the association.

# Correlations: Using real data

```{r}
sleep_data <- import(here("files", "data", "Sleep_Data.csv")) %>% 
  #create an ESS Sum Score
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(ess_tot = sum(c_across(ESS1:ESS8), na.rm = TRUE))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Age x ESS_total: Visualize

Let's examine the overall correlation between Age and overall sleepiness

**First: Visualize**

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

sleep_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, ess_tot)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
```

It doesn't seem like there is much of a relationship here...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Age x ESS_total: Test

Let's check the overall correlation just to see what we are finding

```{r}
cor.test(sleep_data$age, sleep_data$ess_tot)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Writing up a Correlation

Template: *r*(degress of freedom) = the *r* statistic, *p* = *p* value.

Imagine we have conducted a study of 40 students that looked at whether IQ scores and GPA are correlated. We might report the results like this:

> IQ and GPA were found to be moderately positively correlated, *r*(38) = .34, *p* = .032.

Other example:

> Among the students of Hogwarts University, the number of hours playing Fortnite per week and midterm exam results were negatively correlated, *r*(78) = -.45, *p* \< .001.

And another:

> Table 1 reports descriptive statistics and correlations among variables of interest. Knowledge of Weird Al Songs was positively correlated with perceptions of humor for Dr. Haraden (*r*(49) = .79, *p \<*.001), such that the more Weird Al songs a student knew, the more they thought Dr. Haraden was funny.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Writing up: Example

We have all of the pieces for writing up our correlation between age and sleepiness.

Template: *r*(degress of freedom) = the *r* statistic, *p* = *p* value.

> Among the students in the sample, age was negatively related to overall levels of sleepiness (*r*(1450) = -0.06, *p* = .024).

What about our $R^2$ value?

$R^2 = -0.06^2 = 0.0034$. Therefore, approximately 0.34% of the variability in the sleepiness scale (`ess_tot`) is explained by age. Is this meaningful?

# Missing Values in Correlation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Handling Missing - Correlation

-   Listwise Deletion (complete cases)

    ::: incremental
    -   Removes participants completely if they are missing a value being compared
    -   Smaller Sample Sizes
    -   Doesn't bias correlation estimate
    :::

-   Pairwise Deletion

    ::: incremental
    -   Removes participants for that single pair, but leaves information in when there are complete information
    -   Larger Sample Sizes
    -   Could bias estimates if there is a systematic reason things are missing
    :::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
sleep_data %>% 
  select(age, ESS1:ESS8, ess_tot) %>% 
  cor(use = "complete") %>% 
  kable()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
sleep_data %>% 
  select(age, ESS1:ESS8, ess_tot) %>% 
  cor(use = "pairwise") %>% 
  kable()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example: Handling Missing Data

Imagine we've collected data from 5 students on their levels of **anxiety**, **depression**, and **sleep quality** (where a lower score means better sleep).

Our goal is to run a correlation matrix to see how these three variables relate to each other. But notice, we have some missing data (`NA`).

|        |         |            |               |
|--------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **ID** | Anxiety | Depression | Sleep Quality |
| **1**  | 10      | 12         | 5             |
| **2**  | 12      | 14         | 4             |
| **3**  | 15      | `NA`       | 3             |
| **4**  | 18      | 20         | 2             |
| **5**  | 11      | 13         | `NA`          |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Listwise Deletion

**The Rule:** "All or nothing." If a participant is missing data on **any** variable in our list, their entire row is removed from the analysis.

**Applying the Rule:**

-   Participant 3 is missing `Depression`. They're out.

-   Participant 5 is missing `Sleep Quality`. They're out.

**The Resulting Data for Analysis:** This leaves us with only the participants who have complete data on all three variables. We lose 40% of our data

|        |             |                |                   |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **ID** | **Anxiety** | **Depression** | **Sleep Quality** |
| **1**  | 10          | 12             | 5                 |
| **2**  | 12          | 14             | 4                 |
| **4**  | 18          | 20             | 2                 |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pairwise Deletion

**The Rule:** "Case by case." For each individual correlation, we use all participants who have data for **that specific pair** of variables.

Look at each pair to determine the sample sizes

|        |             |                |                   |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **ID** | **Anxiety** | **Depression** | **Sleep Quality** |
| **1**  | 10          | 12             | 5                 |
| **2**  | 12          | 14             | 4                 |
| **3**  | 15          | `NA`           | 3                 |
| **4**  | 18          | 20             | 2                 |
| **5**  | 11          | 13             | `NA`              |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Summary

|  |  |  |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Correlation Pair** | **N with Listwise Deletion** | **N with Pairwise Deletion** |
| Anxiety & Depression | 3 | 4 |
| Anxiety & Sleep Quality | 3 | 4 |
| Depression & Sleep Quality | 3 | 3 |

# Spearman's Rank Correlation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Spearman's Rank Correlation

We need to be able to capture this different (ordinal) "relationship"

-   If student 1 works more hours than student 2, then we can guarantee that student 1 will get a better grade

Instead of using the amount given by the variables ("hours studied"), we rank the variables based on least (rank = 1) to most (rank = 10)

Then we correlate the rankings with one another

# Foundations of Statistics

Who were those white dudes that started this?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Statistics and Eugenics

The concept of the correlation is primarily attributed to Sir Frances Galton

-   He was also the founder of the [concept of eugenics](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/03/eugenics-francis-galton-science-ideas)

The correlation coefficient was developed by his student, [Karl Pearson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Pearson), and adapted into the ANOVA framework by [Sir Ronald Fisher](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/08/01/ra-fisher-and-the-science-of-hatred/)

-   Both were prominent advocates for the eugenics movement

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What do we do with this info?

::: incremental
-   Never use the correlation or the later techniques developed on it? Of course not.

-   Acknowledge this history? Certainly.

-   [Understand how the perspectives](https://medium.com/swlh/is-statistics-racist-59cd4ddb5fa9) of Galton, Fisher, Pearson and others [shaped our practices](http://gppreview.com/2019/12/16/eugenics-ethics-statistical-analysis/)? We must! -- these are not set in stone, [nor are they necessarily the best way](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrybowyer/2016/01/06/beer-vs-eugenics-the-good-and-the-bad-uses-of-statistics/?sh=3114a0c82a14) to move forward.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Be aware of the assumptions

::: incremental
-   Statistics are often thought of as being absent of bias...they are just numbers

-   Statistical significance was a way to avoid talking about nuance or degree.

-   "Correlation does not imply causation" was a refutation of work demonstrating associations between environment and poverty.

-   Need to be particularly mindful of our goals as scientists and how they can influence the way we interpret the findings

# Fancy Tables

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Correlation Tables

Before we used the `cor()` function to create a correlation matrix of our variables

***But what is missing?***

```{r}
sleep_data %>% 
  select(age, ESS1:ESS8, ess_tot) %>% 
  cor(use = "complete") %>% 
  kable()
```

## Correlation Tables - [sjPlot](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/reference/tab_corr.html)

```{r}
sleep_data %>% 
  select(ESS1:ESS8) %>% 
  tab_corr(na.deletion = "listwise", triangle = "lower")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Correlation Tables - [sjPlot](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/reference/tab_corr.html)

So many different cusomizations for this type of plot

Can add titles, indicate what missingness and method

Saves you a TON of time when putting it into a manuscript

# Fancy Visuals

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scatterplot

Before we had a scatterplot that looked like this:

```{r}
sleep_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, ess_tot)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) + 
  labs(
    x = "Age", 
    y = "ESS Total", 
    title = "Relationship between Age and Sleepiness" 
  )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Fancier Scatterplot

Take a look at `ggstatsplot` <https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/>

```{r}
ggscatterstats(
  data = sleep_data, 
  x = age, 
  y = ess_tot, 
  xlab = "Age", 
  ylab = "ESS Total", 
  title = "Relationship between Age and Sleepiness"
)
```
