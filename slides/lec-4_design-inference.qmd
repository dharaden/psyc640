## Design, Sampling, and Inference: From Questions to Models

### Week 4

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Core Challenge

-   **Last week:** We learned to *describe* and *visualize* patterns in our **sample**.

-   **The Rest of the Course:** We want to make claims about the **population**.

-   **The Problem:** How do we know if a pattern we see in our sample (e.g., a difference between groups) is a **"real" effect** or just random **sampling error**?

-   **The Solution:** We build a **statistical model** to test our question against the backdrop of randomness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Blueprint for Analysis

Your research question and design are the blueprint for your statistical model.

**Statistical Model**

-   A formal, mathematical way of representing a relationship between variables.

-   At its heart, a model has a simple, powerful structure that we will use all semester in R:

    ```         
    Outcome ~ Predictor(s)  
    ```

    -   This is read as: "**The Outcome is predicted by the Predictor(s).**"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What are the data? - Measurement

We know we need an *outcome* and a *predictor*. How do we take an abstract construct and transfer it into our data?

**Data**: information gained from observation or experimentation

Data must be ***measurable***

-   Researchers must be able to assign a number, a label, a category or another kind of description to the "stuff"

This is the process of **operationalization**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Measurement

Let's give an example:

Maybe you want to measure age in your study.

| How Old Are You? | \_\_\_\_\_ |
|------------------|------------|

***What might be some responses?***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to Operationalize?

Let's say we are interested in examining stress as an outcome variable.

***Research Question**: Does being aggressively attacked by campus squirrels for your snack increase stress levels?*

> ***You observe someone getting brutally attacked for their snack by a gang of squirrels. Being the researcher that you are, you approach them within 30 minutes after the incident and want to measure their stress levels.***

**How could you measure stress?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Turn to the person/people next to you and identify one way that you could define and measure stress.

### Measurement & Operationalization

As a researcher, you are often needed to make decisions about what to focus on

-   All examples of stress are not just four different ways, but various ways to measure the complex system of stress

**We will never be able to measure things perfectly** [^1]

[^1]: This is field dependent though...sometimes you might be able to be more accurate.

The measure you choose fundamentally defines what you mean by "stress."

Your operationalization is your theory made manifest

-   You are deciding what matters most

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 1 - What is Your Research Question's Goal?

Most research questions in psychology can be simplified into two fundamental goals:

1.  **Comparing Groups:** Are two or more groups different on some continuous outcome?

    -   *Example:* Does our new sleep therapy **group** have **lower** depression scores than the control group?

2.  **Assessing Associations:** Is there a relationship between two continuous variables?

    -   *Example:* Is **more** screen time associated with **higher** ADHD symptoms?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 2 - What Are Your Variables?

The *type* of variables in your question determines the *family* of statistical models you will use.

### Predictor Variable (Independent Variable - IV)

-   **Categorical:** Divides individuals into distinct groups.

    -   e.g., `therapy` vs. `control`; `first_year` vs. `senior`

-   **Continuous:** A variable on a meaningful numeric scale.

    -   e.g., `hours of sleep`, `age in years`, `years in school`

### Outcome Variable (Dependent Variable - DV)

-   For the first half of this course, our DV will almost always be **continuous**.

    -   e.g., `depression score`, `reaction time`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A Decision Tree for Your Model 🌳

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**If your goal is to... COMPARE GROUPS:**

-   Predictor (IV) is **Categorical**

-   Outcome (DV) is **Continuous**

-   👉 You are in the **t-test / ANOVA** family of models.

-   The model looks like: `Continuous_Outcome ~ Categorical_Predictor`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**If your goal is to... ASSESS AN ASSOCIATION:**

-   Predictor (IV) is **Continuous**

-   Outcome (DV) is **Continuous**

-   👉 You are in the **Correlation / Regression** family of models.

-   The model looks like: `Continuous_Outcome ~ Continuous_Predictor`
:::
:::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data to Models to Inference (NHST)

So we have a model, like: `depression_score ~ therapy_group`. How do we test it?

We use the Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) framework:

-   **The Null Hypothesis** $H_0$ : A statement that the predictor has **no relationship** with the outcome in the population. It is the "null model."

    -   $H_0$ : In the population, there is no difference in depression scores between the therapy and control groups. `therapy_group` does **not** predict `depression_score`.

-   **The Alternative Hypothesis** $H_A$ : Our research hypothesis. The predictor **does** have a relationship with the outcome.

    -   $H_A$ : In the population, there **is** a difference. `therapy_group` **does** predict `depression_score`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The p-value

The **p-value** tells us how surprising our sample data would be *if the null hypothesis (the "no relationship" model) were true for the population.*

It's a measure of the incompatibility between our data and the null model.

-   A **small p-value** (p\<.05) suggests that our data are incompatible with the null model. We have evidence to **reject the null model** and conclude that our predictor is likely related to the outcome.

The statistical test you run (`t.test`, `cor.test`, `lm`) is just the engine that calculates the p-value for your specific model. The logic is always the same.

Moving from simply describing our data

*With means and standard deviations*

::: {.column width="50%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Probability - Understanding Randomness

There are several possible interpretations of probability but they (almost) completely agree on the mathematical rules probability must follow:

$P(A)$ = Probablity of event A

0 ≤ $P(A)$ ≤ 1

## The Final Word

Your model tells you if a relationship is *statistically significant*.

But...

-   Your **Design** tells you if you can call that relationship **causal**.

    -   (Requires *random assignment*)

-   Your **Sampling Method** tells you if you can **generalize** that relationship to the population.

    -   (Requires *random sampling*)

### A p-value cannot fix a flawed design!
