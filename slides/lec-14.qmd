## The Adolescent Sleep & Affect Project (ASAP)

First, we need to familiarize ourselves with the variables that are present in the data

**The Dataset:**

-   N = 400 children followed annually for 3 years.

-   3 Timepoints: Baseline (ages 7-9), T2 (8-10), and T3 (9-11)

-   **Key Measures:**

    -   **Psychopathology:** Depression (`Dep`), Anxiety (`Anx`)

    -   **Sleep:** Sleep Duration (`SleepDur`), Sleep Quality (`SleepQual`)

    -   **Stress:** Peer Stress (`PeerStress`), Academic Stress (`AcadStress`)

    -   **Development:** Puberty (`Puberty` on 0-8 scale), Age (`Age`)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
asap <- import(here("files", "data", "asap_data.csv"))
glimpse(asap)
```

## Step 1a: Define Research Question

These variables are fairly intuitive, so you don't have to be an expert in this area to think about a research question. Take a moment and review the data dictionary ([Week 14 page](../week/week-14.html){target="_parent"}) and think about what questions seem interesting to you.

If you have any empirical questions about the data or this area, please ask Dr. Haraden (he is an "expert") for clarification.

Record your research question on the handout that has been provided.
