## From Squirrels to Significance: A Guide to Research Design & Inference

### Week 4

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Journey of a Research Question

-   All research starts with a question about the world.

-   But how do we get from a messy, real-world question to a clean, statistical answer?

**Our Journey Today:**

1.  **Part 1: From Concept to Data** (How do we measure what we care about?)

2.  **Part 2: The Blueprint for Claims** (How do we structure our study?)

3.  **Part 3: From Design to Model** (How do we analyze our data?)

# Part 1: From Concept to Data (Operationalization)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The First & Most Important Choice

-   Before we can analyze anything, we need data. This means turning an abstract concept into a concrete, measurable variable.

-   This process is called **operationalization**.

-   Your operationalization is your argument for what a concept *means* in the context of your study.

## An Outrageous Research Question

Let's imagine a new study. Our research question is:

***Does being aggressively attacked by a campus squirrel for your sandwich increase a student's acute stress?***

-   **Predictor:** `squirrel_incident` (Attacked vs. Not Attacked).

-   **Outcome:** `acute_stress`.

But what *is* "acute stress"? As the researcher, how do you measure it?

# Slide 5: How Would You Measure "Stress"?

Your choice of measurement fundamentally changes the question you are asking.

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
| **Method of Measurement** | **How It Works** | **Data Generated** | **What It Really Measures** |
| **Subjective Self-Report** | "On a scale of 0-100, how stressed do you feel *right now*?" | **Continuous** (0-100) | The **feeling** of stress. |
| **Autonomic Arousal** | Measure heart rate in beats per minute (BPM). | **Continuous** (e.g., 115 BPM) | The **body's alarm** for stress. |
| **Cognitive Impairment** | "Count backward from 1,084 by 7s." Measure speed & accuracy. | **Continuous** (# of errors) | The **brain's processing** under stress. |
| **Coded Facial Expression** | Analyze video for micro-expressions of fear or anger. | **Categorical** or **Ordinal** | The **face's expression** of stress. |

## Part 2: The Blueprint for Claims (Study Design)

# Slide 6: The Two Big Claims

Now that we know *what* we're measuring, let's talk about *how* we structure the study. Your design determines the kind of claim you can make.

1.  **An Associational Claim:** Two variables are related.

    -   *"People who experience squirrel attacks tend to report higher stress."*

2.  **A Causal Claim:** A change in one variable *causes* a change in another.

    -   *"The experience of a squirrel attack causes an increase in stress."*

# Slide 7: The 3 Rules of Causality

To earn the right to say "X causes Y," you must demonstrate three things:

1.  **Covariance:** X and Y are related.

2.  **Temporal Precedence:** The cause (X) must happen *before* the effect (Y).

3.  **Internal Validity:** There are no other plausible explanations (we've ruled out **confounds**).

# Slide 8: The Confounding Variable Problem

A **confound** is a "third variable" that creates a spurious relationship between your two variables. This is the #1 threat to causal claims.

-   **Classic Example:** Ice cream sales are positively correlated with drowning deaths.

-   **The Confound:** Summer heat! Hot weather causes both more ice cream sales and more swimming.

# Slide 9: The Gold Standard for Defeating Confounds: The Experiment

A **True Experiment** is the most powerful tool for establishing causality. It has two magic ingredients:

1.  **Manipulation:** The researcher actively manipulates the Independent Variable (IV).

2.  **Random Assignment:** Every participant has an equal chance of being in any condition. This breaks the links to potential confounds by distributing them evenly across groups.

# Slide 10: Key Design Dimensions

-   **Between-Subjects:** Different groups of people get different conditions. We compare Group A vs. Group B.

-   **Within-Subjects:** The same group of people experiences all conditions. We compare people to themselves.

-   **Cross-Sectional:** All data is collected at a single point in time. (Fails temporal precedence).

-   **Longitudinal:** Data is collected from the same people over multiple time points. (Establishes temporal precedence).

## Part 3: From Design to Model (The Decision Tree)

# Slide 11: The Universal Language of Models

-   Your measurement and design choices create the blueprint for your analysis. They lead you directly to the correct statistical model.

-   All models we learn this semester can be expressed in R with a simple formula:

`Outcome` \~ Predictor

# Slide 12: A Decision Tree for Your Model ðŸŒ³

**If your goal is to... COMPARE GROUPS:**

-   Predictor (IV) is **Categorical**

-   Outcome (DV) is **Continuous**

-   ðŸ‘‰ You are in the **t-test / ANOVA** family of models.

-   Model: `Continuous_Outcome ~ Categorical_Predictor`

**If your goal is to... ASSESS AN ASSOCIATION:**

-   Predictor (IV) is **Continuous**

-   Outcome (DV) is **Continuous**

-   ðŸ‘‰ You are in the **Correlation / Regression** family of models.

-   Model: `Continuous_Outcome ~ Continuous_Predictor`

# Slide 13: Connecting Models to Inference (NHST)

We use our model to test our hypothesis against the backdrop of randomness.

-   **The Null Hypothesis (**H0â€‹**):** The "no relationship" model. It states that your predictor has no relationship with your outcome in the population.

    -   *e.g., "In the population, there is no difference in stress between those who were attacked by squirrels and those who were not."*

-   **The Alternative Hypothesis (**HAâ€‹**):** Your research hypothesis. It states that there *is* a relationship.

# Slide 14: The p-value, Revisited

-   The **p-value** is a measure of surprise. It's the probability of seeing our sample data (or more extreme data) *if the null model were true*.

-   A **small p-value** (p<.05) means our data are very surprising under the null model. This surprise gives us evidence to **reject the null model** in favor of our research hypothesis.

# Slide 15: The Grand Synthesis

This is the most important slide of the day.

-   Your **Statistical Model** (and its p-value) tells you if a relationship is **statistically significant** (i.e., unlikely to be due to random chance).

But...

-   Your **Study Design** tells you if you can call that relationship **causal** (requires random assignment).

-   Your **Sampling Method** tells you if you can **generalize** that relationship to a broader population (requires
