## Scenario and Goal

Welcome back! For this lab you'll step into the role of a data analyst for a clinical psychology lab. Your team has just completed a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) for a new, brief CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) intervention designed to reduce symptoms of depression (`group` variable). You've been given the initial dataset and tasked with running the primary analyses to see if the intervention shows promise.

This dataset includes participant demographics (`sex`, `age`) and depression scores from before (`bdi_pre`) and after (`bdi_post`) the trial. As is common in clinical research, some participants dropped out before the final assessment, resulting in **missing data**.

The BDI is a common measure to assess for symptoms of depression. It stands for the Beck Depression Inventory and higher scores indicate a higher level of depression.

## Exercises

### **Task 1: Setup & Data Inspection (10 points)**

Your first and most important task is always to understand and inspect your data before running any analyses.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Initial Inspection:**

    -   Use `glimpse()` to see the structure of your data.

    -   Use `summary()` to get a quick overview of each variable. **Pay close attention to the `bdi_post` variable.** What do you notice?

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  **Visualization:**

    -   Generate a visualization of the distribution for bdi_pre and bdi_post

        -   These can be two separate figures

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  **Summary Stats (2 tables)**:

    -   Provide descriptive statistics (Means & SD) in a nice looking table for age, bdi_pre, bdi_post. Include a correlation table with those variables as well.

```{r}

```

### **Task 2: Paired-Samples t-test - Did the Individual CBT Work?** 

For participants who received one-on-one therapy (`group == "Individual CBT"`), did their depression scores significantly decrease?

1.  **Filter the data:** Create a new data frame called `individual_tx` that contains *only* the participants from the `Individual CBT` group.

2.  **Run the test:** Conduct a **paired-samples t-test** on the `bdi_pre` and `bdi_post` scores within the `individual_tx` data.

3.  **Interpret the results:** Based on the results, was there a statistically significant change in BDI scores? Describe the direction and magnitude of the change.

```{r}

```

### **Task 3: One-Sample t-test - Achieving Clinical Remission**

A BDI score below 10 is often considered the cutoff for clinical remission. Did our individual CBT group, on average, get below this threshold?

1.  **Run the test:** Using the `individual_tx` data, conduct a **one-sample t-test** on the `bdi_post` scores, testing against a population mean (`mu`) of 10.

2.  **APA Write-up:** Report your results in a full APA-formatted sentence. You will need to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the `bdi_post` scores separately to include in your write-up.

```{r}

```

### **Task 4: One-Way ANOVA**

Now we'll compare the final outcomes (`bdi_post`) across all three groups: Individual CBT, Group CBT, and the Waitlist Control.

1.  **Run the ANOVA:** Using the full `cbt_data`, conduct a one-way ANOVA to test for differences in `bdi_post` among the three `group` conditions.

2.  **Interpret the ANOVA:** Look at the `summary()` of your ANOVA object. Is the overall F-test significant? What does this tell us? Note the degrees of freedomâ€”does the sample size make sense given the data?

3.  **Run Post-Hoc Tests:** A significant ANOVA requires a post-hoc test. Run a **Tukey HSD** test to see which specific groups differ.

4.  **Write a conclusion:** In 2-3 sentences, summarize the findings from the post-hoc test. Which treatment(s) were effective compared to the control group?

```{r}

```

### **Task 5: Independent-Samples t-test - Exploring Sex as a Moderator** 

We were also interested to use exploratory analyses to further understand the impact of the treatment. For instance, did the therapy work equally well for males and females? Let's investigate this.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Calculate change scores:** Create a new data frame called `cbt_active_tx` that contains only the two **active therapy groups** (Individual and Group CBT). Add a new column to it called `bdi_change`, calculated as `bdi_pre - bdi_post`.

2.  **Run the test:** In this `cbt_active_tx` data, conduct an **independent-samples t-test** to see if there is a significant difference in the `bdi_change` scores between participants identified as `Male` and `Female`.

3.  **Visualize and Interpret:** Create a `ggplot` boxplot to visualize the `bdi_change` scores by `sex`. Based on your test and your plot, is there any evidence that the treatment effect was different for males versus females in this pilot study?

```{r}

```
