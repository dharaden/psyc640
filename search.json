    "text": "In-Class Activity: Your First R Session\nGoal: To become familiar with the RStudio interface and perform a basic data exploration workflow.\n\n\nCreate a new Markdown Document\n\nGo to File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown\nProvide the title “Day 1” and input your name as the author\nA script will open in the Source pane. Remove unnecessary code.\nGo to File &gt; Save and name it introduction.Rmd. Make sure this saves in the same folder as all of your other stuff. Stay Organized!\n\nI’m not going to tell you how to organize your folders, but I will give a suggestion. Have 1 folder for the whole class. This will have the Project that we created. Inside there, have a folder for “Class Activities”. This is where you can save this file. Then, have other folders for the labs and what not.\n\n\n\n\nStarting the document\nIn the text field of the markdown file, introduce yourself! Answer these questions below:\n\n\nName:\nPronouns\nYear in school\nPhD/Thesis/Capstone\nArea of psychology\nResearch interests\nComfort with R (1-10 with 10 being “Expert”)\nOverall feelings toward Statistics\nAnything else you want to share\n\n\n\n\nYour First “Analysis”\n\nCreate a Code Chunk\nLoad the tidyverse library\nCreate the object datawars and assign dataset called starwars to it (hint: data &lt;- cars)\nUse View(), head() and glimpse() to look at datawars\nIn the text below, answer these questions:\n\nWhat do each of these do?\nWhich do you like more?\n\nCreate another code chunk and use summary() to get descriptives of all variables in the dataset.\n\nLook at the output of your summary() command. For the mass and height variables, you’ll see a value for NA's. In your own words, what do you think NA means in this context?\n\n\n\nVisualize your data\nNow we want to investigate the relationship between mass and height in this dataset.\n\nCreate a scatterplot using ggplot().\nThe plot should show height on the x-axis and mass on the y-axis.\nAdd some labels to make your plot clear and professional.\n\nHint: Use the code below as a template and fill in the blanks.\n\n\nggplot(data = __, aes(x = __, y = __)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"__\",\n       x = \"__\",\n       y = \"__\")\n\nLook at your plot. Do you notice any characters that seem unusually heavy for their height? Briefly describe one.\n\n\n\nWrangle your Data\nSince we have some outliers that seem to be related to non-human species, let’s just look at Humans.\n\nCreate a new object called rebels.\nThis new object should contain only the characters from the starwars dataset where the species is “Human”.\n\nHint: Use the filter() function. The syntax is new_object &lt;- old_object %&gt;% filter(column_name == \"value\"). Remember that “Human” needs to be in quotes.\n\nPrint your new rebels object to the console to make sure your filter worked correctly. Once confirmed, calculate the average (hint: use mean()) for the height and weight of the rebels.\n\n\nHow many rows are in your new rebels dataset?\nWhat is the average height and weight?\n\n\nCreate another scatterplot with your new dataset. Copy and update the code we used previously.\n\n\n\n\nClosing out the Document\nWhat is 1 thing you are looking forward to this semester and 1 thing that you are worried about (can be in or outside of this class)?\nEnd of the document. Remember to Knit and upload to myCourses."

By default, the describe() function forces non-numeric variables to be numeric and attempts to calculate descriptives for them. These variables are marked with an asterisk (*). In this case, it doesn’t make sense to calculate descriptive statistics for these variables, so we get a warning message and a bunch of NaN’s and NA’s for these variables.\nA better approach would be to remove non-numeric variables before you attempt to run numerical calculations on your dataset."

We are going to practice this A LOT. Especially right in the beginning.\nThis week we are going to expand on some data wrangling to get more comfortable with dplyr and the larger tidyverse. Here is a good website that can also be helpful. Then we will move into an overview of descriptive statistics and how to get them using R. Finally, we will continue with visualizations using ggplot2.

Be sure to have all libraries listed here in the first code chunk along with importing the data. I should not see any lines that say install.packages().\nI will attempt to reproduce your output in my own computer, so be sure that your code is reproducible.\nQuestion 1: Look at the output from your overview. How many total movies are in this database? And what year is the latest movie?\nYour Answer:\nQuestion 2: Calculate the Average budget of the whole dataset. Then, calculate the average for only movies in the year 2000.\nYour Answer:\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Grouped Descriptive Statistics\nAverages for the whole dataset are useful, but we are often more interested in comparing averages between groups. Let’s see if the average budget differs for movies that pass the Bechdel Test versus those that fail. The binary variable tells us this (“PASS” or “FAIL”).\nQuestion 3: Based on your summary table, do movies that pass or fail the Bechdel test have a higher average (mean) budget?\nYour Answer:\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Visualizing a Distribution (Histogram)\nLet’s visualize the distribution of domestic gross earnings (adjusted for 2013) across all the movies.\nQuestion 4: Describe the shape of the distribution you see in the histogram. Is it symmetric (like a bell curve), or is it skewed in one direction? Where do most movies’ earnings seem to be clustered?\nYour Answer:\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Examining the Bechdel Test distribution\nNow we want to see how many movies fall into each of the Bechdel categories. Generate a barplot of the clean_test variable to see what the distribution of the test is.\nThen choose a year in the dataset, create a similar plot (but only for that year). Therefore you should have 2 plots below:\nQuestion 5: Examine both charts and describe the similarities and differences that you are noticing.\nAnswer:\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Comparing Groups with a Boxplot\nNow let’s visually compare the inflation-adjusted international gross (intgross_2013) for movies that pass the Bechdel test versus those that fail. A boxplot is an excellent way to see differences in the median and spread between groups.\nQuestion 6: Look at the boxplot. The thick horizontal line in the middle of each box represents the median. Does there appear to be a large difference in the median domestic gross between movies that pass and fail the test?\nYour Answer:\n\nEnd of Lab 3. You’ve now practiced exploratory data analysis! It is always important to visualize your data to get a good sense of what you are working with. Don’t forget to Knit! 🧶",

Two friends, Frances and Annika, are in disagreement about whether high correlation values are always good in the context of regression. Frances claims that it’s desirable for all variables in the dataset to be highly correlated to each other when building linear models. Annika claims that while it’s desirable for each of the predictors to be highly correlated with the outcome, it is not desirable for the predictors to be highly correlated with each other. Who is right: Frances, Annika, both, or neither? Explain your reasoning using appropriate terminology.\nMeat consumption and life expectancy. In data collected for You et al. (2022), total meat intake is associated with life expectancy (at birth) in 175 countries. Meat intake is measured in kg per capita per year (averaged over 2011 to 2013). The scatterplot on the top left displays the relationship between life expectancy at birth vs. per capita meat consumption. The scatterplot on the top right displays the same relationship colored by income status of the country. The set of scatterplots across the bottom display the same relationship by income status of the country.\n\n\n\nDescribe the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy.\nWhy do you think the variables are positively associated?\nIs the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy stronger, similar, or weaker when broken down by income bracket in the separate plots along the bottom (as compared with the relationship when combined in the top left figure)?\n\n\n\nBaby weights and smoking. US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect information on births recorded in the country. The data used here are a random sample of 1,000 births from 2014. Here, we study the relationship between smoking and weight of the baby. The variable smoke is coded 1 if the mother is a smoker, and 0 if not.

The model output is shown below.\n\n\n\nFor a given release year, which genre of movies are predicted, on average, to have the highest predicted return on investment?\nThe adjusted \\(R^2\\) of this model is 10.71%. Adding the production budget of the movie to the model increases the adjusted \\(R^2\\) to 10.84%. Should production budget be added to the model? Why or Why not?",

We are seeking to examine differences that may arise as a result of country and year.\n\n\nTask 1: Setup & Data Inspection (15 points)\nYour first and most important task is always to understand and inspect your data before running any analyses.\nTasks:\n\nCreate a new R Markdown file named Week11_Lab.Rmd.\nLoad Libraries and Data\nInitial Inspection:\n\nUse glimpse() or summary() to see the structure of your data.\nWhat are all the countries included in this dataset? What is the year range?\n\nVisualization:\n\nGenerate a visualization of the distribution (histogram or bar plot) across all years for each of the mental health variables (5 total plots)\n\nThis will not be separated by country. We want to see what the overall distribution for these variables are for the whole dataset.\n\n\nSummary Stats (2 tables):\n\nProvide descriptive statistics (Means & SD) in a formatted table (not just using describe()) that is separated by country that includes the mental health variables. This will be collapsed across all years.\nInclude a correlation table examining the relationship among all mental health variables for the year 2015. Be sure to include a title and update the labels.\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Categorical Regression (20 points)\nWe are now interested in seeing if there are differences among the years and countries when it comes to the prevalence of these mental health variables.\n\nRegression by country:\n\nInclude 3 different countries and perform 2 regressions to separately predict depression and anxiety (ignoring the year variable; meaning you don’t have to filter by year). For 1 of the regressions, provide a formatted table and write up the results in APA format.\n\nWe should be seeing two regressions that each have the country variable with 3 levels. Then a table and write up for 1 of the regressions.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression by Time:\n\nUsing all countries, include 4 different years and perform 2 regressions to predict depression and anxiety variables. Similar to above, select one of the regressions, provide a formatted table and write up the results in APA.\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Follow-up questions (10 points)\nPlease answer the following information about this dataset and categorical predictors\n\nFor each of your regressions, which group was your reference group? How do you know?\nBased on the results that you have identified in with your regressions, report an overarching conclusion about mental health rates over time/countries.\nA researcher is studying the effect of a student’s undergraduate major on their starting salary after graduation. The major variable has four levels: “Psychology”, “Biology”, “Engineering”, and “English”.\n\nIf you were to include this variable in a regression model using\ndummy coding, how many new dummy variables would you need to create?\nIf you set \"Psychology\" as the reference group, what values would\neach dummy variable have for a student who majored in \"Engineering\"?\n\nIn a linear regression model predicting students’ self-reported well_being scores from their year_in_school (a categorical variable with levels: “First-year”, “Sophomore”, “Junior”, “Senior”), “First-year” is the reference group.\n\nThe model output shows a coefficient of **-2.5** for the\n`year_in_schoolSenior` dummy variable. In one clear sentence, what\nis the correct interpretation of this coefficient?\n\nImagine you refit the model from the previous question, but this time you set \"Senior\" as the reference group instead of \"First-year\".\n\nWould you expect the coefficient for the `year_in_schoolFirst-year`\ndummy variable in this *new* model to be positive, negative, or\nzero? Explain your reasoning in one sentence.\n\n\nFormatting (5 points)\nFormatting includes having clear code and statements in your documents. Avoid including unnecessary information.\nBe sure to submit both an .Rmd file and an HTML file that is complete. Failure to include both will result in an automatic 10 point deduction.",

    "text": "From Reader to Writer\nOne of the most challenging parts of writing a research paper is crafting a clear and compelling results section. How do you go from a folder full of statistical output to a coherent narrative? The best way to learn is to see how experts do it.\nIn this assignment, you will “reverse-engineer” the results section of a published paper. Think of yourself as an apprentice studying a master’s work. Your goal is to uncover the underlying architecture—the deliberate choices the author made to guide the reader through their findings. This process will help you build a mental toolkit of effective strategies for your own writing.\n\n\nInstructions\n\nStep 1: Select a Research Article\n\nFind a peer-reviewed, quantitative research article in a topic area that interests you. The article should be a strong example of clear scientific writing.\nThe article should test one or more specific hypotheses using statistical methods we have discussed or will be discussing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, correlation, regression).\nDo not choose a meta-analysis, literature review, or qualitative study.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create Your Writer’s Blueprint\nRead the results section with a writer’s eye. Your task is to outline the author’s “moves.” For each paragraph or distinct analytical block, your outline should explain the narrative strategy. Instead of just summarizing, analyze how and why the paragraph is constructed the way it is.\nFor each section of your outline, describe:\n\nThe Narrative Goal: What is the author’s primary goal for this paragraph? What key question is it answering for the reader? (e.g., “Here, the author is setting the stage by confirming the randomization worked,” or “This is the crucial paragraph where they test their main hypothesis.”).\nThe Writing Strategy: How did they structure the paragraph to achieve that goal? Notice the flow. Do they lead with a plain-language summary? How do they present the statistical evidence in support of their claim? (e.g., “The author uses a ‘Claim-First’ structure: they state the finding in words, then provide the stats to back it up.”).\n\n\n\n\nExample\nConsider this fictional paragraph from a results section:\n\nTo test our primary hypothesis that the CBT intervention would reduce social anxiety symptoms more than the waitlist control condition, we conducted an independent-samples t-test on post-treatment SAQ scores. The analysis revealed a significant difference between the groups, t(72) = 3.88, p &lt; .001. The mean SAQ score for the CBT group (M = 24.5, SD = 5.1) was significantly lower than the mean score for the waitlist control group (M = 35.2, SD = 6.3), indicating a strong treatment effect.\n\nYour blueprint entry for this paragraph might look like this:\n\nParagraph 3: Testing the Main Hypothesis.\n\nNarrative Goal: To present the findings for the study’s primary research question.\nWriting Strategy:\n\nState the Why: They begin by explicitly stating which hypothesis they are testing and what analysis they used (independent-samples t-test).\n\nDeliver the Punchline: They immediately present the finding (t(72)=3.88,p&lt;.001).\nExplain in Context: Translate the statistic back into meaningful terms by presenting the group means, making the result easy to understand.\nThis “Purpose -&gt; Evidence -&gt; Interpretation” flow is a powerful and clear way to structure a finding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Submit\nPlease submit a single document to myCourses with:\n\nA full APA-style citation of the article you selected\nYour complete “Writer’s Blueprint” of the article’s results section."

    "section": "Project Steps",
    "text": "Project Steps\n\nPart 1: Setup and Data Import\nYour first step is to set up your R Markdown document and load the data.\n\nLoad Libraries: At the top of your R Markdown script, load all the necessary libraries. You don’t have to know every single library to use here. Just be sure to add them to this section as you are going through your code.\nLoad the Data: Use the appropriate function (e.g., read_csv()). Be sure that this is easily reproducible on another computer.\n\n\n\nPart 2: Data Cleaning and Scoring\nReal-world data is often messy. In this part, you will wrangle the data and create new variables needed for your analysis.\n\nScoring the ARS-SF (Anxiety Resilience Scale - Short Form): We need to first reverse score Item #6. Then we can create two subscales:\n\nAnxiety Subscale - Calculate the mean of Items 1, 2 & 3.\nResilience Subscale - Calculate the mean of Items 4, 5 & 6(reversed).\n\nRecoding Variables: Create a new, cleanly labeled factor variable for any grouping variable (see example code below on how to do this). Recode the numeric values (e.g., 1s and 2s) to meaningful labels (e.g., “Male” and “Female”).\n\n# Recode the grouping variable into a factor with clear labels\nanalytic_data &lt;- analytic_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    [FACTOR_VARIABLE_NAME] = factor([ORIGINAL_VARIABLE],\n                                  levels = c(1, 2),\n                                  labels = c(\"Group 1 Label\", \"Group 2 Label\"))\n  )\n\n\nPart 3: Descriptive Statistics\nNow that you have clean data, let’s describe it.\n\nContinuous variabels: Get descriptive statistics (mean, sd, median, range) for the continuous variables (Note: when reporting the ARS-SF, just use the subscale scores).\nFrequencies: Use table() or count() to get the frequency distribution for the categorical variables.\nWrite-up: Write a brief paragraph summarizing the descriptive statistics. Report the mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and the counts and percentages for categorical variables.\n\nFor this write-up, focus on the age, sex, group and well-being variables. Include all variables in a table.\n\n\nExample: “The sample consisted of N = 143 participants (22% female) with an average age of 102.3 (SD = .03). 45% of the sample were students…”\n\n\nPart 4: Correlation Analysis\nNext, examine the associations between the continuous variables.\n\nCreate a Correlation Matrix: Generate a table of the correlations (hint: use sjPlot). Be sure to include a title and have the labels make sense.\nWrite-up: Report the results in APA style. Describe the direction, strength, and statistical significance of the correlation between the Anxiety score and General Well Being.\n\n\n\nPart 5: Group Differences\nTest for differences in your outcome variable across the three groups.\n\nRun the t-test or ANOVA: Test if the General Well-being score differs significantly across the levels of group. Conduct any follow-up/post-hoc analyses if necessary.\nVisualize the Difference: Create a plot showing the distribution of outcome for each of the groups.\nWrite-up: Report the results in APA style. State whether there was a significant effect of the grouping variable on the outcome. Report follow-up/post-hoc analyses if necessary.\n\n\n\nPart 6: Regression Analysis\nFinally, build a simple linear regression model to predict the General Well-being outcome. Select one predictor variable that you want to investigate.\n\nFit the Model: Use the lm() function to fit a regression model.\nView the Summary: Use summary() to get the detailed results of your model.\nVisualize the Model: Create a scatter plot (ggplot) showing the relationship between the variables (be sure to include a fit line, titles and nice axis labels)\nWrite-up: Write a paragraph summarizing the regression results in APA style. Report the overall model fit (R-squared and F-statistic) and the coefficients for the predictor, noting the statistical significance.\n\nNice work! Don’t forget to 🧶knit the document to submit!",

You will need to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the bdi_post scores separately to include in your write-up.\n\n\n\nTask 4: One-Way ANOVA\nNow we’ll compare the final outcomes (bdi_post) across all three groups: Individual CBT, Group CBT, and the Waitlist Control.\n\nRun the ANOVA: Using the full cbt_data, conduct a one-way ANOVA to test for differences in bdi_post among the three group conditions.\nInterpret the ANOVA: Look at the summary() of your ANOVA object. Is the overall F-test significant? What does this tell us? Note the degrees of freedom—does the sample size make sense given the data?\nRun Post-Hoc Tests: A significant ANOVA requires a post-hoc test. Run a Tukey HSD test to see which specific groups differ.\nWrite a conclusion: In 2-3 sentences, summarize the findings from the post-hoc test. Which treatment(s) were effective compared to the control group?\n\n\n\nTask 5: Independent-Samples t-test - Exploring Sex as a Moderator\nWe were also interested to use exploratory analyses to further understand the impact of the treatment. For instance, did the therapy work equally well for males and females? Let’s investigate this.\nTasks:\n\nCalculate change scores: Create a new data frame called cbt_active_tx that contains only the two active therapy groups (Individual and Group CBT). Add a new column to it called bdi_change, calculated as bdi_pre - bdi_post.\nRun the test: In this cbt_active_tx data, conduct an independent-samples t-test to see if there is a significant difference in the bdi_change scores between participants identified as Male and Female.\nVisualize and Interpret: Create a ggplot boxplot to visualize the bdi_change scores by sex. Based on your test and your plot, is there any evidence that the treatment effect was different for males versus females in this pilot study?\n\n\nEnd of Lab. Don’t forget to Knit! 🧶",

If you would like to request academic adjustments such as testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. Contact information for the DSO and information about how to request adjustments can be found at www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive academic adjustment approval, it is imperative that you contact me as early as possible so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.\n\n\n\nAs an instructor, I have a mandatory reporting responsibility as a part of my role. It is my goal that you feel comfortable sharing information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to report information I receive regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred during your time at RIT. \n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT’s policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators when incidents are stated to them directly. The information you provide to a non-confidential resource which includes faculty will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek resolution. Even RIT Offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible.\nIf an individual discloses information during a public awareness event, a protest, during a class project, or advocacy event, RIT is not obligated to investigate based on this public disclosure. RIT may however use this information to further educate faculty, staff and students about prevention efforts and available resources.\nIf you would like to report an incident of gender based discrimination or harassment directly you may do so by using the online Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting or anonymously by using the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from any of RIT’s confidential resources (listed below).\n\nRIT Counseling and Psychological Services\n\n585-475-2261 (V)\n585-475-6897 (TTY)\nwww.rit.edu/counseling\n\nNTID Counseling and Academic Advising\n\n585-475-6400\nwww.ntid.rit.edu/counselingdept\n\nRIT Student Health Center\n\n585-475-2255 (V)\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/studenthealth\n\nCenter for Religious Life\n\n585-475-2137\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/religion\n\nRIT Ombuds Office\n\n585-475-7357\n585-475-6424\n585-286-4677 (VP)\nwww.rit.edu/ombuds/contact-us\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. The Department of Psychology encourages all students to become familiar with the RIT Honor Code and with RIT’s Academic Integrity Policy. RIT’s policy on academic integrity requires the instructor to investigate of any suspected breach of academic integrity. If the preponderance of evidence indicates a breach of academic integrity, the student who did so may incur a consequence up to and including failure for the entire course.\nAbout Generative AI\nEach course that you are involved in will have differing opinions and goals regarding generative AI (i.e., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, etc.). In this course you are allowed to use these as a tool. You can use prompts such as “Teach me about (insert psych topic here) and give me an example that might apply to me.” If you do use generative AI, I would like for you to disclose that information just so I can have a sense of how it is being used. If I suspect that the work that you have turned in is using AI, we will have to have a conversation to determine the next steps. Turning in AI work is considered plagiarism, and you may be asked to re-do the assignment, or possibly receive a 0 on the assignment.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to the safety of the RIT community and beyond. Because the situation is still in a rapid state of change, checking the RIT Ready website, and specifically the RIT Safety Plan for the most up to date information is recommended: https://www.rit.edu/ready/rit-safety-plan.\n\n\n\nI have provided this syllabus as a guide to our course and have made every attempt to provide an accurate overview of the course.

Instead of relying on a fixed decision tree, we will practice linking the substance of a question and the structure of the data to the choice of an analytic method. The goal is to foster statistical reasoning, where the model serves the scientific inquiry.\nInstructions: This lab has two parts. For each scenario, provide the requested information, focusing on clear and concise justifications. Please submit your completed lab as a single document.",

    "text": "Part 1: From Research Question to Statistical Model\nFor each of the following scenarios, you are given a description of a research goal, similar to what might be in an intro.\n\nIdentify the most appropriate statistical model from the options we have covered so far (T-test (i.e., Independent, Dependent, Single Sample), One-Way ANOVA, or Simple Linear Regression).\nWrite a brief (2-3 sentences) justification for your choice. Your justification must reference:\n\nThe nature of the predictor variable (e.g., categorical with two levels, continuous).\nThe nature of the outcome variable.\nWhat the key research question is asking for (e.g., a mean difference, a predictive relationship, a linear trend).\n\n\n\n\nScenario A\n\n“Previous research suggests that individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) show deficits in cognitive control. However, it is unclear if this deficit is present in those with sub-threshold depressive symptoms. To address this, we recruited two independent groups of young adults: one group meeting formal criteria for MDD (n=50) and a control group with no history of psychiatric disorders (n=50). We hypothesized that the MDD group would show lower performance on the Stroop task, a measure of cognitive control, compared to the control group.”\n\n\n1. Statistical Model:\n2. Justification:\n\n\n\nScenario B\n\n“Sleep continuity is vital for well-being, yet its direct relationship with daily mood in non-clinical populations is not well-characterized. We conducted a study to examine whether the number of times a person wakes up during the night predicts their self-reported mood the following morning. We collected data from 100 university students, measuring their number of nocturnal awakenings via a wrist-worn device and their morning mood on a 100-point scale. We expect that a higher number of awakenings will be associated with a lower mood score.”\n\n\n1. Statistical Model:\n2. Justification:\n\n\n\nScenario C\n\n“Parental expressed emotion is a key factor in the home environment. We are interested in whether there are differences in academic achievement among adolescents from three distinct home environments, characterized by low, moderate, or high levels of expressed parental criticism. We categorized 150 adolescents into one of these three groups based on a structured family interview and obtained their grade point average (GPA) for the academic year.”\n\n\n1. Statistical Model:\n2. Justification:\n\n\n\nScenario D\n\n“A core symptom of social anxiety disorder is the avoidance of social situations. To test a new intervention, we conducted a randomized controlled trial where participants were assigned to either a 12-week mindfulness-based therapy group or a psychoeducation control group. At the end of the trial, we measured the number of social events each participant attended in the final week. We hypothesize that the mindfulness group will attend a greater number of social events on average than the control group.”\n\n\n1. Statistical Model:\n2. Justification:\n\n\n\nScenario E\n\n“It is well-established that age is related to cognitive function, but the specific trajectory is of interest. To explore this, we gathered a cross-sectional sample of 200 adults ranging from age 20 to 80. Each participant completed a standardized test of working memory. Our primary goal is to model the linear relationship between a person’s age and their working memory score to understand the rate of change across the lifespan.”\n\n\n1. Statistical Model:\n2. Justification:\n\n\n\nScenario F\n\n“Chronic stress during adolescence can impact physiological regulation. We are interested in whether adolescents who report experiencing high, medium, or low levels of chronic life stress show differences in their morning cortisol levels, a key biomarker of the stress response system. We collected saliva samples from 90 adolescents who were categorized into one of the three stress groups based on a validated questionnaire.”\n\n\n1. Statistical Model:\n2. Justification:",

You administered a 10-item personality questionnaire, where participants responded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree). This measure is called the “Ten Item Personality Inventory” (TIPI) and more information about the measure can be found here: TIPI Scale Info. Please refer to this page and documents to help with scoring the data and getting familiar with the measure.\nHowever, the raw data from the survey software is messy. Your goal in this lab is to import, clean, and score the data to prepare it for analysis. This process of turning raw data into usable data is called data wrangling, and it’s what researchers spend most of their time doing.\nYou will learn to: * Import a CSV file. * Rename variables for clarity. * Filter out participants based on data quality checks. * Reverse-score negatively worded items. * Compute a composite score for a psychological scale.\n\n\nGetting Data\nBe aware of your file structure and how things are organized. For some refreshers, take a look at the Resources and rstats.wtf\n\nDownload your data\nDownload Data from Drive (CSV)\nDownload Questionnaire From Drive (DOC)\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Importing and Inspecting the Data\nFirst, you need to load the appropriate packages and import your data. Use the tidyverse, rio, and here libraries.\n# Load the appropriate libraries.   \n\n# Write your import code here:   \n  ## This will look like:     \n  # your_data_name &lt;- import(here(\"path\", \"to\", \"file\", \"filename.csv))    \n\n\n# Use glimpse() to get a first look at the raw_data. \n# Write your code here:  \nQuestion 1: How many participants (rows) are in the raw, imported dataset?\n❓Your Answer: [Type your answer here]\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Renaming Variables for Clarity\nThe column names are a mixture of naming conventions. Let’s rename them to be consistent and convey the appropriate information.\nFirst, let’s take a look at what the names are. You can do this by using View(), but let’s use the names() function to list out all the column names.\nnames(Whatever_you_Named_your_data)\nThis will give you your list of names. You can see which ones we may want to rename. What does Q85 even mean? Thanks Qualtrics. Review the documentation for the survey to get a sense of what the questions are asking to properly rename the variables.\nFor now, let’s update the names as follows. It is helpful to keep everything lowercase to make it easier to type (but this is a personal preference), and make sure there aren’t any spaces in your variable names:\n\nID -&gt; id\nProgress -&gt; progress\nDuration (in seconds) -&gt; duration\nConsent -&gt; consent\nQ85 -&gt; sex_orient\nQ85_6_TEXT -&gt; sex_orient_txt\nSleep Quality -&gt; sleep_qual\nHours of Sleep -&gt; sleep_hours\n\n# Task: Use the rename() function to change the variable names as listed above.\n# Create a new object called `renamed_data`.\n# Hint: The syntax is: new_object &lt;- old_object %&gt;% rename(new_name_1 = old_name_1, new_name_2 = old_name_2)\n\n# Write your code here:\n# This part is a placeholder as the actual column names from the URL will differ.\n# Be sure to update the following template with the info from your own data\nrenamed_data &lt;- raw_data %&gt;%\n  rename(participant_id = country, \n         grit_1 = year,\n         grit_2 = population)\n         # ... and so on for the other variables\n\n# Print the first few rows of your new `renamed_data` object to check your work.\nhead(renamed_data)\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Filtering for Data Quality\nOur survey includes variables that allow us to see how long they took and what percentage they completed. We should remove participants who did not finish the survey, as well as those who finished it too quickly.\nThis will be done using the filter() function (more about filter). Use filter to keep participants where their progress is equal to 100. You will also want to remove participants who completed the survey in less than 7 minutes (note: the Duration variable is in seconds).\n# Create a new object called `filtered_data`.\n\n# Example code:\n# filtered_data &lt;- renamed_data %&gt;%\n#   filter(Progress == 100) %&gt;% \n#   filter(Duration ==, &lt;, &gt; 1000)\nQuestion 2: How many participants remain from your original dataset? How many participants did you remove with your filters?\n❓Your Answer: [Type your answer here]\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Reverse-Scoring Items\nIn a lot of psychological research, we need to reverse score variables. They are often worded in a negative/positive way compared to the rest of the items. Review the TIPI documentation to see what items need to be reverse scored.\nFor example, Item 2 is a item that should reflect “Agreeableness”, but the rated words are “Critical, quarrelsome”. Therefore low score on this item would reflect high amounts of Agreeableness.\nThe formula for reverse scoring an item is: (Maximum Possible Value + 1) - Original Score. So, for the TIPI, it’s 8 - TIPI_2.\nTo create/compute a new variable we use the mutate() function (more about mutate). I like to remember this function name because we are “mutating” the data and introducing another “growth” or something extra that wasn’t there before.\n# Task: Use the mutate() function to create new, reverse-scored variables.\n# Use a new name to indicate which items are reverse-scored.\n# Create a new object called `scored_data`.\n# Hint: The syntax is: \n  # new_object &lt;- old_object %&gt;% \n  #   mutate(new_variable = computation, \n  #          new_variable2 = computation)\n\n\n# Exmple code:\n# scored_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n#   mutate(TIPI_2r = 8 - TIPI_2)\n\n\n\n# Print the first few rows, showing only the original and new reverse-scored item to check your work.\n\n# scored_data %&gt;% select(TIPI_2, TIPI_2r) %&gt;% head()\nQuestion 3: If a participant’s original score on TIPI_4 was a 6, what would their score be on the new TIPI_4r variable?\n❓Your Answer: [Type your answer here]\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Computing and Finalizing the Scored File\nNow we are ready to compute the final score! There are individual subscales for each of the 5 factors of the Big 5 Personality Inex. Compute the 5 scales. Remember to use the reverse-scored items (TIPI_2r), not the original one.s\n# Task 1: Use mutate() to calculate the total grit score.\n# Sum the items corresponding to each scale.\n# Call the new variables 'extra', 'agree', 'consc', 'emo', 'open.\n# Overwrite your `scored_data` object with this new version.\n\n# Task 2: Create a final, clean dataset.\n# Use select() to keep only the 'id' and Big 5 scale columns.\n# Call this object `final_data`.\n# Conceptual code:\n# final_data &lt;- scored_data %&gt;%\n#   select(id, agree, ...)\n\n\n\n# Task 3: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each of the subscale scores.\nQuestion 4: What would be the highest possible Emotional Stability score a participant could get? What would be the lowest?\n❓Your Answer: [Type your answer here]\nQuestion 5: Report the mean’s and standard deviations of each of the subscale scores\n❓Your Answer:\n\nExtraversion:\nAgreeableness:\nConscientiousness:\nEmotional Stability:\nOpenness to Experience:\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Visualize Relationships\nWe often want to see the relationship between 2 variables. This is often done using a scatterplot. Select 2 scales that you would like to see the relationship between. Use the code from the previous lab/class to create a scatterplot of the relationship. Take a look at this cheat sheet to help with ggplot2!\n# Using ggplot and the scored data you have, generate a scatterplot. It can be as simple or as fancy as you would like (try putting a title and changing the axis names)\n\n\n\n# Use the cheat sheet and other materials to put a straight line to the data (Hint: add another layer with a smooth geom)\nQuestion 6.1: Visually inspect the chart you have and describe the relationship below. Be sure to include the two variables and an estimate of your correlation in your answer.\n❓Your Answer:\n# Compute a correltion for your variables\n# Hint: use the `cor.test()` function. You will need to specify the variable names as `name_of_data$name_of_variable`\n  \n  # Example\n    # cor.test(starwars$height, starwars$mass)\nQuestion 6.2: Calculate the correlation coefficient for your two variables of interest (refer here for more info). Report the correlation, and reflect on how close or how far away your initial estimate was. Do your best here. I recognize that we haven’t really gone over this just yet.\n❓Your Answer:\n\nEnd of Lab. Don’t forget to Knit! 🧶",

The top of the web page provides three links for downloading R. Follow the link that describes your operating system: Windows or Mac.\n\n\nTo install R on Windows, click the “Download R for Windows” link.Then click the “base” link. Next, click the first link at the top of the new page. This link should say something like “Download R 4.3.1 for Windows,” except the 4.3.1 will be replaced by the most current version of R. The link downloads an installer program, which installs the most up-to-date version of R for Windows. Run this program and step through the installation wizard that appears. The wizard will install R into your program files folders and place a shortcut in your Start menu. Note that you’ll need to have all of the appropriate administration privileges to install new software on your machine.\n\n\n\nTo install R on a Mac, click the “Download R for Mac’’ link. Next, click on the “R-4.3.1-arm64.pkg” package link (or the package link for the most current release of R that is appropriate for your computer). An installer will download to guide you through the installation process, which is very easy. The installer lets you customize your installation, but the defaults will be suitable for most users.

Now almost everyone uses R with an application called RStudio, and I recommend that you do, too.\nGo ahead and try to open R without using R-Studio. You will get something like this:"

    "text": "R-Studio: Download and Install\nRStudio is an application like Microsoft Word—except that instead of helping you write in English, RStudio helps you write in R. We will use RStudio throughout because it makes working with R SO much easier. Plus there are a lot of additional functionalities that RStudio has that will expand what you can do (e.g., RMarkdown). Also, the RStudio interface looks the same for the various operating systems which will make teaching and your experience with the material a lot easier.\nRStudio (the company) has recently changed their name to Posit. To download RStudio, you can navigate to the Posit download page for “RStudio Desktop”. We have already completed Step 1 (you could have just come here to download it, but it is helpful to know where to get the latest versions and materials)! All you have to do is select the box under “2: Install RStudio” to download. It should recognize the operating system that you are using, but if it does not, you will just need to scroll down the page to identify the appropriate installer.\nNow you are all set and ready to go! Nice job following the instructions and getting R and RStudio on your computer. Next you can begin to customize and get used to using RStudio. Remember, this is not something that is scary or a thing you can “break”. When in doubt, check out Google or reach out to the professor!"

    "text": "Setting things up\nHere are some things that I am going to suggest to make your experience with R as good as we possibly can. Some of the suggestions here are related to your workflow while others are direct settings within R…and some are both. We are all complex creatures. \nA lot of my suggestions will come from “What They Forgot to Teach You About R”. As I use other sites or things, I will do my best to have links to the original.\nThis list will continue to develop and expand. It is a work in progress (just like most of us)\n\nStart R with a blank slate each time Link\nNavigate to Tools &gt; Global Options\nBy default, R Studio saves all of the objects in your environment. In general, this is not ideal, because it means that you may have taken steps interactively that are not documented in your code.\n\nThis would be like when you are baking, and you follow the recipe, but then you add in some cinnamon and nutmeg which the recipe doesn’t call for. You also measure out some extra chocolate chips and brown sugar, but you end up not using that. The cookies come out fantastic and you want to make them again. You open up your kitchen and the cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate chips and brown sugar are all there, but nothing says that you need them in your recipe. We don’t want to keep all the old information. We only want what is in the recipe (after we update it to include the extra spices).\n\n\nDecorate\nNavigate to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Appearance\nThis is all yours! Take ownership and find a cool theme that you like. Make it look nice and how you want it.\n\nRight now I am rocking the “Chaos” theme with my fonts a little larger because apparently I am getting older."

The goal of the course is to provide a grounding in statistical concepts, methods and application to research. I aim to increase student’s confidence in using these techniques and introducing them to R. Topics will range from including mathematical conceptualizations to practical application with various techniques ranging from descriptive statistics to regression.\n\n\n\n\nWe will be using R for all data wrangling, visualization, and analysis. You may use another statistical program in this course, but I will only be providing examples in R. Students must have the latest version of R and it is strongly recommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, both can be found here. Both types of software are free.\nWe will primarily be referring to chapters in the following textbooks:\n\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics (2e) (Cetinkaya-Rundel & Hardin, 2024)\nLearning Statistics with R (Navarro)\nR for Data Science (2e) (Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, & Grolemund, 2023)\nModern Statistics with R (2e) (Thullin, 2025)\nStatistical Thinking (Poldrack, 2024)\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning (2e) (James, Witten, Hastie & Tibshirani, 2023)\nData Analysis: A Model Comparison Approach to Regression, ANOVA, and Beyond (3rd ed.) (Judd, McClelland, & Ryan, 2017)\n\nThese textbooks are available for free online and able to be downloaded. You may choose to purchase a paper copy if you wish, but it is not required.\nAll additional readings will be provided by the instructor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote: Readings on the schedule will need to be completed prior to the course they are listed for. We will build on the concepts you read about in that specific class period, so it is important that you have read.\n\n\n\nCourse Goals\n\nBuild confidence in statistical reasoning & analysis.\nApply regression-based methods to real-world research questions.\nDevelop practical R skills for data wrangling, visualization, and reporting.\nProduce a portfolio-ready, reproducible final analysis.\n\n\nEvaluation and Grading\nYour grade is a reflection of your consistent effort, active engagement with the material, and ability to apply new concepts. The components are designed to build on one another, leading to a comprehensive understanding of data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nWeight\n\n\nWeekly Labs\n30%\n\n\nJournal Entries\n10%\n\n\nParticipation & Engagement\n15%\n\n\nMidterm Project\n20%\n\n\nFinal Project\n25%\n\n\n\nWeekly Labs\nThese are hands-on R assignments that directly reinforce the concepts from the week’s class. They are your primary opportunity to practice coding, build models, and interpret results. Labs will be submitted as R Markdown files, and your lowest score will be dropped. Labs will be due the Sunday night (11:59pm) before the next class.\nJournal Entries\nEach week, you will submit a short, reflective journal entry. This is a space for metacognition—thinking about your own learning. Prompts will include questions like, “What was the clearest concept this week, and why did it click?” or “What was the ‘muddiest’ point for you, and what question would you ask about it?”. They can also take the form of just a general reflection. I want to get to know you and your learning throughout this process. This can also include anything related to your personal life or mental health that you would like for me to know, such as whether you are struggling to balance classes and research, having trouble creating a workspace at home, or whether you can balance time spent on campus and off. This can also be completely random things, like a news article you can’t stop thinking about, or a favorite TV show, movie or book that you just love (especially if it is LOTR or Cosmere related). The content of what you write has no impact on your grade. In addition, what you write will be kept confidential.\nThe purpose of this “assignment” is to help facilitate communication between you and me. I have found other instructors using this and I would like to be able to develop supportive relationships with students, so I decided to implement this. Other instructors reported that they found that many students were more comfortable discussing questions and concerns in their journal assignments rather than through email.\nIn-Class Engagement & Activities\nOur class is a workshop, and your active participation is key. This portion of your grade is earned by being present and engaged. This includes participating in group discussions, engaging with the readings, working with peers on problems, and completing the small, hands-on coding exercises we’ll do together or in small groups in class. This is a low-stress grade based on your consistent effort and collaboration during our classes.\nMidterm Project\nThis is a comprehensive analysis of a dataset I will provide. You will be asked to clean and visualize the data, formulate a research question, build an appropriate regression model, check its assumptions, and write a concise report of your findings. This project assesses your mastery of the first half of the course and will be due before the first class after Fall Break.\nFinal Project\nFor your final project, you will choose a dataset (either your own research data or from a list of options), develop your own research questions, and conduct a full analysis from start to finish. You will present your work in a short, manuscript-style report and a brief “lightning talk” to the class in our final meeting. This is your capstone assignment to demonstrate your independent data analysis skills.\nGrade Scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nA\nA-\nB+\nB\nB-\nC+\nC\nC-\nD\nF\n\n\n\n\nPercentage\n93+\n90-92\n87-89\n83-86\n80-82\n77-79\n73-76\n70-72\n60-69\n&lt;60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“A Wizard is never late, nor are they early.

If you would like to request academic adjustments such as testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. Contact information for the DSO and information about how to request adjustments can be found at www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive academic adjustment approval, it is imperative that you contact me as early as possible so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.\n\n\n\nAs an instructor, I have a mandatory reporting responsibility as a part of my role. It is my goal that you feel comfortable sharing information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to report information I receive regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred during your time at RIT. \n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT’s policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators when incidents are stated to them directly. The information you provide to a non-confidential resource which includes faculty will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek resolution. Even RIT Offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible.\nIf an individual discloses information during a public awareness event, a protest, during a class project, or advocacy event, RIT is not obligated to investigate based on this public disclosure. RIT may however use this information to further educate faculty, staff and students about prevention efforts and available resources.\nIf you would like to report an incident of gender based discrimination or harassment directly you may do so by using the online Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting or anonymously by using the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from any of RIT’s confidential resources (listed below).\n\nRIT Counseling and Psychological Services\n\n585-475-2261 (V)\n585-475-6897 (TTY)\nwww.rit.edu/counseling\n\nNTID Counseling and Academic Advising\n\n585-475-6400\nwww.ntid.rit.edu/counselingdept\n\nRIT Student Health Center\n\n585-475-2255 (V)\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/studenthealth\n\nCenter for Religious Life\n\n585-475-2137\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/religion\n\nRIT Ombuds Office\n\n585-475-7357\n585-475-6424\n585-286-4677 (VP)\nwww.rit.edu/ombuds/contact-us\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. The Department of Psychology encourages all students to become familiar with the RIT Honor Code and with RIT’s Academic Integrity Policy. RIT’s policy on academic integrity requires the instructor to investigate of any suspected breach of academic integrity. If the preponderance of evidence indicates a breach of academic integrity, the student who did so may incur a consequence up to and including failure for the entire course.\nAbout Generative AI\nYou may use generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, or CoPilot) as a support for your work in this course. However:\n\nYou must personally review, edit, and take ownership of all submitted work.\nAny use of AI must be acknowledged in a brief note at the end of the assignment (e.g., “I used ChatGPT to generate initial bullet points for my resume, which I then revised and expanded.”) as well as being properly cited (RIT Library Citation Infoguide)\nAI tools may not be used to generate entire assignments without your input or to misrepresent your work. Submitting unedited or minimally edited AI output as your own is considered academic dishonesty.\nIn professional contexts, you will be expected to present work that is authentically your own — this course is practice for that.\n\nIf I suspect that the work that you have turned in is using AI, we will have to have a conversation to determine the next steps. Turning in AI work is considered plagiarism, and you may be asked to re-do the assignment, or possibly receive a 0 on the assignment. Your information may also be submitted to the university as a Breach of Academic Integrity.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to the safety of the RIT community and beyond. Because the situation is still in a rapid state of change, checking the RIT Ready website, and specifically the RIT Safety Plan for the most up to date information is recommended: https://www.rit.edu/ready/rit-safety-plan.\n\n\n\nI have provided this syllabus as a guide to our course and have made every attempt to provide an accurate overview of the course.

    "text": "Course Plan\nThis is subject to change and instructor will inform the students as soon as possible.\n\nWeek 1 — Getting Started with R & Tidy Data\n\nWe’ll dive right into our primary tool, R. This session covers installing R and RStudio, navigating the interface, understanding R projects, and learning the foundational syntax of the R language and the tidyverse, including data types and basic functions.\n\nWeek 2 — LABOR DAY (NO CLASS)\n\nContinue to develop skills and comfort in R. You will be provided with readings and other practice problems, and maybe a video lecture.\n\nWeek 3 — Describing, Visualizing & Communicating\n\nWhat is in our data? We’ll learn how to calculate descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) and master the “grammar of graphics” to create compelling, publication-quality plots with ggplot2. We will also introduce R Markdown for creating reproducible reports.\n\nWeek 4 — Designing Studies & Sampling\n\nThis is a conceptual week focusing on the foundations of research. We’ll discuss different research designs (experimental, correlational), sampling methods, the distinction between a sample and a population, and the fundamental logic of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST).\n\nWeek 5 — Correlations & Effect Sizes\n\nWe’ll quantify the relationship between two continuous variables using covariance and correlation. We will also introduce the concept of effect sizes as a standardized way to describe the magnitude of a relationship, moving beyond a simple “yes/no” significance test. “How strong is the association?”\n\nWeek 6 — Comparing Groups\n\nWe’ll explore classic methods for comparing group means, including independent and paired-samples t-tests. We’ll conduct these tests in R and learn how to interpret their output. This will serve as our first formal hypothesis-testing tool.\n\nWeek 7 — Building to Regression: Variability & Model Fit\n\nWe’ll introduce the core logic of the General Linear Model by partitioning variance. Concepts like sums of squares will be introduced to help us understand how a model “explains” variance in an outcome variable. We will introduce R2 as a fundamental measure of model fit. “How much of the outcome can we explain?”\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8 — FALL BREAK (NO CLASS) 🍂\n\n\n\nWeek 9 — Simple Linear Regression\n\nThe formal introduction to the regression model: Yi​=β0​+β1​Xi​+ϵi​. We will learn how to estimate the model’s parameters (intercept and slope), interpret their meaning, and assess overall model fit using the lm() function in R. “What is the exact formula for prediction?”\n\n\n\n\nWeek 10 — Multiple Regression I: Adding Predictors\n\nWe’ll expand our model to include multiple continuous predictors. Key topics include interpreting partial slopes (the effect of one predictor while controlling for others), understanding adjusted R2, and identifying issues like multicollinearity.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 11 — Multiple Regression II: Categorical Predictors\n\nHow do we include groups (e.g., experimental conditions) in our regression model? We’ll learn about dummy coding and indicator variables. This is where we will explicitly demonstrate that t-tests and ANOVA are simply special cases of regression.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 12 — Assumptions + Model Diagnostics\n\nIs our model trustworthy? We will learn how to check the assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, including linearity, normality of residuals, and homoscedasticity. We will use graphical methods in R to diagnose problems and discuss potential remedies.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 13 — Expanding Regression\n\nTopics: We will explore ways to capture more complex relationships in our data. The primary focus will be on adding interaction terms to the model to test for moderation, but we may also touch on including non-linear relationships (e.g., quadratic terms) or talk about some mediation!\n\n\n\n\nWeek 14 — Model Building + Comparison\n\nHow do we choose the best model? We will discuss practical strategies for building models, such as hierarchical regression, and learn how to use information criteria (like AIC and BIC) to compare different competing models.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 15 — Making R work for you\n\nWe’ve worked a whole lot with R, but what are some of the cool things that it can do. We will explore and organize what we have learned so far to solidify the use of R for reproducible workflows!\n\n\n\n\nWeek 16 — Wrapping Up + Workshop\n\nThis final session will serve two purposes. First, it will be a dedicated workshop for you to get help and ask questions about your final projects. Second, we will have a course wrap-up, reviewing the major themes and discussing next steps for your statistical journey.",

You only want to keep the data from your city. Create a new dataset that has only your city in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe’ve used dplyr a lot to move our data around. Maybe it has something to do with select() or filter() or mutate()\n\n\n❓How many total observations are there in your new dataset (for your city)?\n✅Answer:\n\n\n\nCalculating Descriptives\nYou should now have 2 datasets (1 for the entire sample, and 1 for your city). Calculate and report the mean and standard deviation for your city. Then calcullate and report the mean and standard deviation for the whole sample.\n\n\n\nYour City\nTotal Sample\n\n\n\n\nSleep Mean:\nSleep Mean:\n\n\nSleep SD:\nSleep SD:\n\n\nEnergy Mean:\nEnergy Mean:\n\n\nEnergy SD:\nEnergy SD:\n\n\n\n❓How are the mean and standard deviations similar/different?\n✅Answer:\n\n\n\nReporting Descriptive Statistics\nNow that you have each of the pieces of information calculated for the entire sample and your specific city, you can report it in text. It is important to be able to report these basic descriptive statistics in a meaningful way, so we will practice it as often as possible. Here is an example:\n\nThe sample as a whole was relatively young (M = 19.22, SD = 3.45).\nThe average amount of drinks consumed was 3.37 (SD = 0.92).\n\n❓Report the means and standard deviations in text for the two variables in your city sample.\n✅Answer:\n\n\n\nVisualizing\nWe have two variables and we would like to examine the relationship between them. Use a scatterplot to highlight the relationship between these two variables for your city.\nBe sure that your plot has a clear main title and clear labels for each axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLook back to the lecture or past labs and pull in some of the ggplot code that you have! You can always re-use code.\n\n\n❓Describe the overall look of the data for your city.\n✅Answer:\n\nAs a class, we will review the different cities to see if we would be able to come to some broad conclusion.\nEnd of the document.
