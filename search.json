    "text": "Scenario and Goal\nCongratulations, you‚Äôve just collected data for a study on ‚ÄúPersonality‚Äù! You administered a 10-item personality questionnaire, where participants responded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree). This measure is called the ‚ÄúTen Item Personality Inventory‚Äù (TIPI) and more information about the measure can be found here: TIPI Scale Info. Please refer to this page and documents to help with scoring the data and getting familiar with the measure.\nHowever, the raw data from the survey software is messy. Your goal in this lab is to import, clean, and score the data to prepare it for analysis. This process of turning raw data into usable data is called data wrangling, and it‚Äôs what researchers spend most of their time doing.\nYou will learn to: * Import a CSV file. * Rename variables for clarity. * Filter out participants based on data quality checks. * Reverse-score negatively worded items. * Compute a composite score for a psychological scale.\n\n\nGetting Data\nBe aware of your file structure and how things are organized. For some refreshers, take a look at the Resources and rstats.wtf\n\nDownload your data\nDownload Data from Drive (CSV)\nDownload Questionnaire From Drive (DOC)\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Importing and Inspecting the Data\nFirst, you need to load the appropriate packages and import your data. Use the tidyverse, rio, and here libraries.\n# Load the appropriate libraries.   \n\n# Write your import code here:   \n  ## This will look like:     \n  # your_data_name &lt;- import(here(\"path\", \"to\", \"file\", \"filename.csv))    \n\n\n# Use glimpse() to get a first look at the raw_data. \n# Write your code here:  \nQuestion 1: How many participants (rows) are in the raw, imported dataset?\n‚ùìYour Answer: [Type your answer here]\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Renaming Variables for Clarity\nThe column names are a mixture of naming conventions. Let‚Äôs rename them to be consistent and convey the appropriate information.\nFirst, let‚Äôs take a look at what the names are. You can do this by using View(), but let‚Äôs use the names() function to list out all the column names.\nnames(Whatever_you_Named_your_data)\nThis will give you your list of names. You can see which ones we may want to rename. What does Q85 even mean? Thanks Qualtrics. Review the documentation for the survey to get a sense of what the questions are asking to properly rename the variables.\nFor now, let‚Äôs update the names as follows. It is helpful to keep everything lowercase to make it easier to type (but this is a personal preference), and make sure there aren‚Äôt any spaces in your variable names:\n\nID -&gt; id\nProgress -&gt; progress\nDuration (in seconds) -&gt; duration\nConsent -&gt; consent\nQ85 -&gt; sex_orient\nQ85_6_TEXT -&gt; sex_orient_txt\nSleep Quality -&gt; sleep_qual\nHours of Sleep -&gt; sleep_hours\n\n# Task: Use the rename() function to change the variable names as listed above.\n# Create a new object called `renamed_data`.\n# Hint: The syntax is: new_object &lt;- old_object %&gt;% rename(new_name_1 = old_name_1, new_name_2 = old_name_2)\n\n# Write your code here:\n# This part is a placeholder as the actual column names from the URL will differ.\n# Be sure to update the following template with the info from your own data\nrenamed_data &lt;- raw_data %&gt;%\n  rename(participant_id = country, \n         grit_1 = year,\n         grit_2 = population)\n         # ... and so on for the other variables\n\n# Print the first few rows of your new `renamed_data` object to check your work.\nhead(renamed_data)\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Filtering for Data Quality\nOur survey includes variables that allow us to see how long they took and what percentage they completed. We should remove participants who did not finish the survey, as well as those who finished it too quickly.\nThis will be done using the filter() function (more about filter). Use filter to keep participants where their progress is equal to 100. You will also want to remove participants who completed the survey in less than 7 minutes (note: the Duration variable is in seconds).\n# Create a new object called `filtered_data`.\n\n# Example code:\n# filtered_data &lt;- renamed_data %&gt;%\n#   filter(Progress == 100) %&gt;% \n#   filter(Duration ==, &lt;, &gt; 1000)\nQuestion 2: How many participants remain from your original dataset? How many participants did you remove with your filters?\n‚ùìYour Answer: [Type your answer here]\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Reverse-Scoring Items\nIn a lot of psychological research, we need to reverse score variables. They are often worded in a negative/positive way compared to the rest of the items. Review the TIPI documentation to see what items need to be reverse scored.\nFor example, Item 2 is a item that should reflect ‚ÄúAgreeableness‚Äù, but the rated words are ‚ÄúCritical, quarrelsome‚Äù. Therefore low score on this item would reflect high amounts of Agreeableness.\nThe formula for reverse scoring an item is: (Maximum Possible Value + 1) - Original Score. So, for the TIPI, it‚Äôs 8 - TIPI_2.\nTo create/compute a new variable we use the mutate() function (more about mutate). I like to remember this function name because we are ‚Äúmutating‚Äù the data and introducing another ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù or something extra that wasn‚Äôt there before.\n# Task: Use the mutate() function to create new, reverse-scored variables.\n# Use a new name to indicate which items are reverse-scored.\n# Create a new object called `scored_data`.\n# Hint: The syntax is: \n  # new_object &lt;- old_object %&gt;% \n  #   mutate(new_variable = computation, \n  #          new_variable2 = computation)\n\n\n# Exmple code:\n# scored_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n#   mutate(TIPI_2r = 8 - TIPI_2)\n\n\n\n# Print the first few rows, showing only the original and new reverse-scored item to check your work.\n\n# scored_data %&gt;% select(TIPI_2, TIPI_2r) %&gt;% head()\nQuestion 3: If a participant‚Äôs original score on TIPI_4 was a 6, what would their score be on the new TIPI_4r variable?\n‚ùìYour Answer: [Type your answer here]\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Computing and Finalizing the Scored File\nNow we are ready to compute the final score! There are individual subscales for each of the 5 factors of the Big 5 Personality Inex. Compute the 5 scales. Remember to use the reverse-scored items (TIPI_2r), not the original one.s\n# Task 1: Use mutate() to calculate the total grit score.\n# Sum the items corresponding to each scale.\n# Call the new variables 'extra', 'agree', 'consc', 'emo', 'open.\n# Overwrite your `scored_data` object with this new version.\n\n# Task 2: Create a final, clean dataset.\n# Use select() to keep only the 'id' and Big 5 scale columns.\n# Call this object `final_data`.\n# Conceptual code:\n# final_data &lt;- scored_data %&gt;%\n#   select(id, agree, ...)\n\n\n\n# Task 3: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each of the subscale scores.\nQuestion 4: What would be the highest possible Emotional Stability score a participant could get? What would be the lowest?\n‚ùìYour Answer: [Type your answer here]\nQuestion 5: Report the mean‚Äôs and standard deviations of each of the subscale scores\n‚ùìYour Answer:\n\nExtraversion:\nAgreeableness:\nConscientiousness:\nEmotional Stability:\nOpenness to Experience:\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Visualize Relationships\nWe often want to see the relationship between 2 variables. This is often done using a scatterplot. Select 2 scales that you would like to see the relationship between. Use the code from the previous lab/class to create a scatterplot of the relationship. Take a look at this cheat sheet to help with ggplot2!\n# Using ggplot and the scored data you have, generate a scatterplot. It can be as simple or as fancy as you would like (try putting a title and changing the axis names)\n\n\n\n# Use the cheat sheet and other materials to put a straight line to the data (Hint: add another layer with a smooth geom)\nQuestion 6.1: Visually inspect the chart you have and describe the relationship below. Be sure to include the two variables and an estimate of your correlation in your answer.\n‚ùìYour Answer:\n# Compute a correltion for your variables\n# Hint: use the `cor.test()` function. You will need to specify the variable names as `name_of_data$name_of_variable`\n  \n  # Example\n    # cor.test(starwars$height, starwars$mass)\nQuestion 6.2: Calculate the correlation coefficient for your two variables of interest (refer here for more info). Report the correlation, and reflect on how close or how far away your initial estimate was. Do your best here. I recognize that we haven‚Äôt really gone over this just yet.\n‚ùìYour Answer:\n\nEnd of Lab. Don‚Äôt forget to Knit! üß∂",

Be sure to have all libraries listed here in the first code chunk along with importing the data. I should not see any lines that say install.packages().\nI will attempt to reproduce your output in my own computer, so be sure that your code is reproducible.\nQuestion 1: Look at the output from your overview. How many total movies are in this database? And what year is the latest movie?\nYour Answer:\nQuestion 2: Calculate the Average budget of the whole dataset. Then, calculate the average for only movies in the year 2000.\nYour Answer:\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Grouped Descriptive Statistics\nAverages for the whole dataset are useful, but we are often more interested in comparing averages between groups. Let‚Äôs see if the average budget differs for movies that pass the Bechdel Test versus those that fail. The binary variable tells us this (‚ÄúPASS‚Äù or ‚ÄúFAIL‚Äù).\nQuestion 3: Based on your summary table, do movies that pass or fail the Bechdel test have a higher average (mean) budget?\nYour Answer:\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Visualizing a Distribution (Histogram)\nLet‚Äôs visualize the distribution of domestic gross earnings (adjusted for 2013) across all the movies.\nQuestion 4: Describe the shape of the distribution you see in the histogram. Is it symmetric (like a bell curve), or is it skewed in one direction? Where do most movies‚Äô earnings seem to be clustered?\nYour Answer:\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Examining the Bechdel Test distribution\nNow we want to see how many movies fall into each of the Bechdel categories. Generate a barplot of the clean_test variable to see what the distribution of the test is.\nThen choose a year in the dataset, create a similar plot (but only for that year). Therefore you should have 2 plots below:\nQuestion 5: Examine both charts and describe the similarities and differences that you are noticing.\nAnswer:\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Comparing Groups with a Boxplot\nNow let‚Äôs visually compare the inflation-adjusted international gross (intgross_2013) for movies that pass the Bechdel test versus those that fail. A boxplot is an excellent way to see differences in the median and spread between groups.\nQuestion 6: Look at the boxplot. The thick horizontal line in the middle of each box represents the median. Does there appear to be a large difference in the median domestic gross between movies that pass and fail the test?\nYour Answer:\n\nEnd of Lab 3. You‚Äôve now practiced exploratory data analysis!

    "text": "Manipulating Variables\n\nExtract columns with select()\nThe select() function subsets columns in your data frame. This is particularly useful when you have a data set with a huge number of variables and you want to narrow down to the variables that are relevant for your analysis.\nThe first argument is data, followed by the name(s) of the column(s) you want to subset. Note that you can use variable positions rather than their names, but this is usually not as useful. Let‚Äôs go through some simple examples of common uses of select().\nSelect one variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsleep_data %&gt;%\nselect(bed_study)\n\n\n\nSelect multiple variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsleep_data %&gt;%\nselect(bed_study, bed_read, bed_friends)\n\n\n\nSelect a range of variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsleep_data %&gt;%\nselect(bed_study:bed_videogames) %&gt;%\nnames()\n\n\n\nDe-select variables with a minus sign (-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsleep_data %&gt;%\nselect(-age)\n\n\n\nDe-select range of variables\nNote: everything() is a helper function that gives us all the remaining variables in the data frame (see more onhelper functions below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsleep_data %&gt;%\nselect(-(ESS1:everything())\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper functions for select()\nThere are some ‚Äúhelper‚Äù functions that you can use along with select() that can sometimes be more efficient than selecting your variables explicitly by name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction\nwhat it does\n\n\nstarts_with()\nselects columns starting with a string\n\n\nends_with()\nselects columns that end with a string\n\n\ncontains()\nselects columns that contain a string\n\n\nmatches()\nselects columns that match a regular expression\n\n\nnum_ranges()\nselects columns that match a numerical range\n\n\none_of()\nselects columns whose names match entries in a character vector\n\n\neverything()\nselects all columns\n\n\nlast_col()\nselects last column; can include an offset.\n\n\n\nQuick example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsleep_data %&gt;%\nselect(starts_with(‚Äúa‚Äù)\n\n\n\n\n\nMake new variables with mutate()\nThe mutate() function is most commonly used to add new columns to your data frame that are functions of existing columns.\nmutate() requires data as its first argument, followed by a set of expressions defining new columns.

If you would like to request academic adjustments such as testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. Contact information for the DSO and information about how to request adjustments can be found at www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive academic adjustment approval, it is imperative that you contact me as early as possible so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.\n\n\n\nAs an instructor, I¬†have a mandatory reporting responsibility¬†as a part of¬†my role. It is my goal that you feel comfortable sharing information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to¬†report information I¬†receive¬†regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred during your time at RIT.¬†\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT‚Äôs policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT‚Äôs Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators when incidents are stated to them directly. The information you provide to a non-confidential resource which includes faculty will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek resolution. Even RIT Offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible.\nIf an individual discloses information during a public awareness event, a protest, during a class project, or advocacy event, RIT is not obligated to investigate based on this public disclosure. RIT may however use this information to further educate faculty, staff and students about prevention efforts and available resources.\nIf you would like to report an incident of gender based discrimination or harassment directly you may do so by using the online Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting or anonymously by using the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from any of RIT‚Äôs confidential resources (listed below).\n\nRIT Counseling and Psychological Services\n\n585-475-2261 (V)\n585-475-6897 (TTY)\nwww.rit.edu/counseling\n\nNTID Counseling and Academic Advising\n\n585-475-6400\nwww.ntid.rit.edu/counselingdept\n\nRIT Student Health Center\n\n585-475-2255 (V)\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/studenthealth\n\nCenter for Religious Life\n\n585-475-2137\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/religion\n\nRIT Ombuds Office\n\n585-475-7357\n585-475-6424\n585-286-4677 (VP)\nwww.rit.edu/ombuds/contact-us\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. The Department of Psychology encourages all students to become familiar with the RIT Honor Code and with RIT‚Äôs Academic Integrity Policy. RIT‚Äôs policy on academic integrity requires the instructor to investigate of any suspected breach of academic integrity. If the preponderance of evidence indicates a breach of academic integrity, the student who did so may incur a consequence up to and including failure for the entire course.\nAbout Generative AI\nEach course that you are involved in will have differing opinions and goals regarding generative AI (i.e., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, etc.). In this course you are allowed to use these as a tool. You can use prompts such as ‚ÄúTeach me about (insert psych topic here) and give me an example that might apply to me.‚Äù If you do use generative AI, I would like for you to disclose that information just so I can have a sense of how it is being used. If I suspect that the work that you have turned in is using AI, we will have to have a conversation to determine the next steps. Turning in AI work is considered plagiarism, and you may be asked to re-do the assignment, or possibly receive a 0 on the assignment.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to the safety of the RIT community and beyond. Because the situation is still in a rapid state of change, checking the RIT Ready website, and specifically the RIT Safety Plan for the most up to date information is recommended: https://www.rit.edu/ready/rit-safety-plan.\n\n\n\nI have provided this syllabus as a guide to our course and have made every attempt to provide an accurate overview of the course. However, as instructor, I reserve the right to modify this document during the semester, if necessary, to ensure that we achieve course learning objectives. You will receive advance notice of any changes to the syllabus through myCourses/email."

Contact information for the DSO and information about how to request adjustments can be found at www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive academic adjustment approval, it is imperative that you contact me as early as possible so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.\n\n\n\nAs an instructor, I¬†have a mandatory reporting responsibility¬†as a part of¬†my role. It is my goal that you feel comfortable sharing information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to¬†report information I¬†receive¬†regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred during your time at RIT.¬†\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT‚Äôs policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT‚Äôs Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators when incidents are stated to them directly. The information you provide to a non-confidential resource which includes faculty will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek resolution. Even RIT Offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible.\nIf an individual discloses information during a public awareness event, a protest, during a class project, or advocacy event, RIT is not obligated to investigate based on this public disclosure. RIT may however use this information to further educate faculty, staff and students about prevention efforts and available resources.\nIf you would like to report an incident of gender based discrimination or harassment directly you may do so by using the online Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting or anonymously by using the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from any of RIT‚Äôs confidential resources (listed below).\n\nRIT Counseling and Psychological Services\n\n585-475-2261 (V)\n585-475-6897 (TTY)\nwww.rit.edu/counseling\n\nNTID Counseling and Academic Advising\n\n585-475-6400\nwww.ntid.rit.edu/counselingdept\n\nRIT Student Health Center\n\n585-475-2255 (V)\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/studenthealth\n\nCenter for Religious Life\n\n585-475-2137\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/religion\n\nRIT Ombuds Office\n\n585-475-7357\n585-475-6424\n585-286-4677 (VP)\nwww.rit.edu/ombuds/contact-us\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. The Department of Psychology encourages all students to become familiar with the RIT Honor Code and with RIT‚Äôs Academic Integrity Policy. RIT‚Äôs policy on academic integrity requires the instructor to investigate of any suspected breach of academic integrity. If the preponderance of evidence indicates a breach of academic integrity, the student who did so may incur a consequence up to and including failure for the entire course.\nAbout Generative AI\nEach course that you are involved in will have differing opinions and goals regarding generative AI (i.e., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, etc.). In this course you are allowed to use these as a tool. You can use prompts such as ‚ÄúTeach me about (insert psych topic here) and give me an example that might apply to me.‚Äù If you do use generative AI, I would like for you to disclose that information just so I can have a sense of how it is being used. If I suspect that the work that you have turned in is using AI, we will have to have a conversation to determine the next steps. Turning in AI work is considered plagiarism, and you may be asked to re-do the assignment, or possibly receive a 0 on the assignment.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to the safety of the RIT community and beyond. Because the situation is still in a rapid state of change, checking the RIT Ready website, and specifically the RIT Safety Plan for the most up to date information is recommended: https://www.rit.edu/ready/rit-safety-plan.\n\n\n\nI have provided this syllabus as a guide to our course and have made every attempt to provide an accurate overview of the course. However, as instructor, I reserve the right to modify this document during the semester, if necessary, to ensure that we achieve course learning objectives. You will receive advance notice of any changes to the syllabus through myCourses/email."

You only want to keep the data from your city. Create a new dataset that has only your city in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe‚Äôve used dplyr a lot to move our data around. Maybe it has something to do with select() or filter() or mutate()\n\n\n‚ùìHow many total observations are there in your new dataset (for your city)?\n‚úÖAnswer:\n\n\n\nCalculating Descriptives\nYou should now have 2 datasets (1 for the entire sample, and 1 for your city). Calculate and report the mean and standard deviation for your city. Then calcullate and report the mean and standard deviation for the whole sample.\n\n\n\nYour City\nTotal Sample\n\n\n\n\nSleep Mean:\nSleep Mean:\n\n\nSleep SD:\nSleep SD:\n\n\nEnergy Mean:\nEnergy Mean:\n\n\nEnergy SD:\nEnergy SD:\n\n\n\n‚ùìHow are the mean and standard deviations similar/different?\n‚úÖAnswer:\n\n\n\nReporting Descriptive Statistics\nNow that you have each of the pieces of information calculated for the entire sample and your specific city, you can report it in text. It is important to be able to report these basic descriptive statistics in a meaningful way, so we will practice it as often as possible. Here is an example:\n\nThe sample as a whole was relatively young (M = 19.22, SD = 3.45).\nThe average amount of drinks consumed was 3.37 (SD = 0.92).\n\n‚ùìReport the means and standard deviations in text for the two variables in your city sample.\n‚úÖAnswer:\n\n\n\nVisualizing\nWe have two variables and we would like to examine the relationship between them. Use a scatterplot to highlight the relationship between these two variables for your city.\nBe sure that your plot has a clear main title and clear labels for each axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLook back to the lecture or past labs and pull in some of the ggplot code that you have! You can always re-use code.\n\n\n‚ùìDescribe the overall look of the data for your city.\n‚úÖAnswer:\n\nAs a class, we will review the different cities to see if we would be able to come to some broad conclusion.\nEnd of the document.

They should be able to run it.\n\n\n\nOn Your Own\nGoal: Work individually or in small groups to apply the concepts from today‚Äôs lecture and demo to a new dataset.\n\nObjectives:\n\nIdentify predictor and outcome variables from a research question.\nUse the ‚Äúdecision tree‚Äù to select the correct family of statistical models.\nCreate an appropriate visualization (ggplot).\nRun the correct statistical test (t.test or cor.test).\nWrite a one-sentence conclusion synthesizing the results.\n\n\n\nThe Scenario & Dataset\nA developmental psychology lab is exploring factors related to children‚Äôs well-being. They have collected pilot data from 100 children.\nDownload Child Well-Being Data (.csv)\nPlease download the child_wellbeing.csv file (above). It contains the following variables:\n\nchild_id: A unique identifier for each child.\nparenting_style: The primary parenting style observed in the home (Categorical: ‚ÄúAuthoritative‚Äù or ‚ÄúPermissive‚Äù).\nsleep_hours: The average number of hours the child sleeps per night (Continuous).\nanxiety_score: A score from 0-50 on a parent-report measure of the child‚Äôs anxiety (Continuous).\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nCreate a new R Markdown file titled week4_inclass.Rmd.\nLoad the appropriate libraries.\nLoad the child_wellbeing.csv dataset.\nFor each task below, write the R code and answer the questions.\n\n\n\nTask 1: Parenting Style and Anxiety\nThe Research Question: ‚ÄúDo children raised in homes with an authoritative parenting style have different anxiety levels than children in homes with a permissive style?‚Äù\nYour Steps:\n\nIdentify: What is the predictor (IV)? What is the outcome (DV)? Are they categorical or continuous?\nModel: Based on your answer, what is the correct model family (t-test/ANOVA or Correlation/Regression)? Write out the specific model using R formula syntax (outcome ~ predictor).\nVisualize: Create a boxplot to visualize the relationship between parenting_style and anxiety_score.\nAnalyze: Run the appropriate statistical test in R to test your model.\nConclude: Look at the p-value and the group means from your analysis. Write one clear sentence summarizing your finding (e.g., ‚ÄúWe found that children with authoritative parents had significantly higher/lower anxiety scores than children with permissive parents, p = ‚Ä¶‚Äù).\n\n\n\nTask 2: Sleep and Anxiety\nThe Research Question: ‚ÄúIs there an association between the average number of hours a child sleeps per night and their anxiety level?‚Äù\nYour Steps:\n\nIdentify: What is the predictor (IV)? What is the outcome (DV)? Are they categorical or continuous?\nModel: What is the correct model family? Write out the specific model using R formula syntax.\nVisualize: Create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between sleep_hours and anxiety_score. Add a line of best fit.\nAnalyze: Run the appropriate statistical test in R.\nConclude: Look at the p-value and the correlation coefficient (r). Write one clear sentence summarizing your finding (e.g., ‚ÄúWe found a significant positive/negative association between hours of sleep and anxiety scores, r = ‚Ä¶, p = ‚Ä¶‚Äù).\n\n\n\nü§î Challenge Question (If you finish early)\nBased on the design of this study (it is observational), can the researcher conclude that permissive parenting causes higher anxiety? In one or two sentences, explain why or why not, and propose one possible confounding variable that could be influencing both parenting style and a child‚Äôs anxiety\n\nEnd of the document.

We are going to practice this A LOT. Especially right in the beginning.\nThis week we are going to expand on some data wrangling to get more comfortable with dplyr and the larger tidyverse. Here is a good website that can also be helpful. Then we will move into an overview of descriptive statistics and how to get them using R. Finally, we will continue with visualizations using ggplot2.

The goal of the course is to provide a grounding in statistical concepts, methods and application to research. I aim to increase student‚Äôs confidence in using these techniques and introducing them to R. Topics will range from including mathematical conceptualizations to practical application with various techniques ranging from descriptive statistics to regression.\n\n\n\n\nWe will be using R for all data wrangling, visualization, and analysis. You may use another statistical program in this course, but I will only be providing examples in R. Students must have the latest version of R and it is strongly recommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, both can be found here. Both types of software are free.\nWe will primarily be referring to chapters in the following textbooks:\n\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics (2e) (Cetinkaya-Rundel & Hardin, 2024)\nLearning Statistics with R (Navarro)\nR for Data Science (2e) (Wickham, √áetinkaya-Rundel, & Grolemund, 2023)\nModern Statistics with R (2e) (Thullin, 2025)\nStatistical Thinking (Poldrack, 2024)\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning (2e) (James, Witten, Hastie & Tibshirani, 2023)\nData Analysis: A Model Comparison Approach to Regression, ANOVA, and Beyond (3rd ed.) (Judd, McClelland, & Ryan, 2017)\n\nThese textbooks are available for free online and able to be downloaded. You may choose to purchase a paper copy if you wish, but it is not required.\nAll additional readings will be provided by the instructor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote: Readings on the schedule will need to be completed prior to the course they are listed for. We will build on the concepts you read about in that specific class period, so it is important that you have read.\n\n\n\nCourse Goals\n\nBuild confidence in statistical reasoning & analysis.\nApply regression-based methods to real-world research questions.\nDevelop practical R skills for data wrangling, visualization, and reporting.\nProduce a portfolio-ready, reproducible final analysis.\n\n\nEvaluation and Grading\nYour grade is a reflection of your consistent effort, active engagement with the material, and ability to apply new concepts. The components are designed to build on one another, leading to a comprehensive understanding of data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nWeight\n\n\nWeekly Labs\n30%\n\n\nJournal Entries\n10%\n\n\nParticipation & Engagement\n15%\n\n\nMidterm Project\n20%\n\n\nFinal Project\n25%\n\n\n\nWeekly Labs\nThese are hands-on R assignments that directly reinforce the concepts from the week‚Äôs class. They are your primary opportunity to practice coding, build models, and interpret results. Labs will be submitted as R Markdown files, and your lowest score will be dropped. Labs will be due the Sunday night (11:59pm) before the next class.\nJournal Entries\nEach week, you will submit a short, reflective journal entry. This is a space for metacognition‚Äîthinking about your own learning. Prompts will include questions like, ‚ÄúWhat was the clearest concept this week, and why did it click?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat was the ‚Äòmuddiest‚Äô point for you, and what question would you ask about it?‚Äù. They can also take the form of just a general reflection. I want to get to know you and your learning throughout this process. This can also include anything related to your personal life or mental health that you would like for me to know, such as whether you are struggling to balance classes and research, having trouble creating a workspace at home, or whether you can balance time spent on campus and off. This can also be completely random things, like a news article you can‚Äôt stop thinking about, or a favorite TV show, movie or book that you just love (especially if it is LOTR or Cosmere related). The content of what you write has no impact on your grade. In addition, what you write will be kept confidential.\nThe purpose of this ‚Äúassignment‚Äù is to help facilitate communication between you and me. I have found other instructors using this and I would like to be able to develop supportive relationships with students, so I decided to implement this. Other instructors reported that they found that many students were more comfortable discussing questions and concerns in their journal assignments rather than through email.\nIn-Class Engagement & Activities\nOur class is a workshop, and your active participation is key. This portion of your grade is earned by being present and engaged. This includes participating in group discussions, engaging with the readings, working with peers on problems, and completing the small, hands-on coding exercises we‚Äôll do together or in small groups in class. This is a low-stress grade based on your consistent effort and collaboration during our classes.\nMidterm Project\nThis is a comprehensive analysis of a dataset I will provide. You will be asked to clean and visualize the data, formulate a research question, build an appropriate regression model, check its assumptions, and write a concise report of your findings. This project assesses your mastery of the first half of the course and will be due before the first class after Fall Break.\nFinal Project\nFor your final project, you will choose a dataset (either your own research data or from a list of options), develop your own research questions, and conduct a full analysis from start to finish. You will present your work in a short, manuscript-style report and a brief ‚Äúlightning talk‚Äù to the class in our final meeting. This is your capstone assignment to demonstrate your independent data analysis skills.\nGrade Scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nA\nA-\nB+\nB\nB-\nC+\nC\nC-\nD\nF\n\n\n\n\nPercentage\n93+\n90-92\n87-89\n83-86\n80-82\n77-79\n73-76\n70-72\n60-69\n&lt;60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúA Wizard is never late, nor are they early.

If you would like to request academic adjustments such as testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. Contact information for the DSO and information about how to request adjustments can be found at www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive academic adjustment approval, it is imperative that you contact me as early as possible so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.\n\n\n\nAs an instructor, I¬†have a mandatory reporting responsibility¬†as a part of¬†my role. It is my goal that you feel comfortable sharing information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to¬†report information I¬†receive¬†regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred during your time at RIT.¬†\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT‚Äôs policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT‚Äôs Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators when incidents are stated to them directly. The information you provide to a non-confidential resource which includes faculty will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek resolution. Even RIT Offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible.\nIf an individual discloses information during a public awareness event, a protest, during a class project, or advocacy event, RIT is not obligated to investigate based on this public disclosure. RIT may however use this information to further educate faculty, staff and students about prevention efforts and available resources.\nIf you would like to report an incident of gender based discrimination or harassment directly you may do so by using the online Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting or anonymously by using the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from any of RIT‚Äôs confidential resources (listed below).\n\nRIT Counseling and Psychological Services\n\n585-475-2261 (V)\n585-475-6897 (TTY)\nwww.rit.edu/counseling\n\nNTID Counseling and Academic Advising\n\n585-475-6400\nwww.ntid.rit.edu/counselingdept\n\nRIT Student Health Center\n\n585-475-2255 (V)\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/studenthealth\n\nCenter for Religious Life\n\n585-475-2137\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/religion\n\nRIT Ombuds Office\n\n585-475-7357\n585-475-6424\n585-286-4677 (VP)\nwww.rit.edu/ombuds/contact-us\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. The Department of Psychology encourages all students to become familiar with the RIT Honor Code and with RIT‚Äôs Academic Integrity Policy. RIT‚Äôs policy on academic integrity requires the instructor to investigate of any suspected breach of academic integrity. If the preponderance of evidence indicates a breach of academic integrity, the student who did so may incur a consequence up to and including failure for the entire course.\nAbout Generative AI\nYou may use generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, or CoPilot) as a support for your work in this course. However:\n\nYou must personally review, edit, and take ownership of all submitted work.\nAny use of AI must be acknowledged in a brief note at the end of the assignment (e.g., ‚ÄúI used ChatGPT to generate initial bullet points for my resume, which I then revised and expanded.‚Äù) as well as being properly cited (RIT Library Citation Infoguide)\nAI tools may not be used to generate entire assignments without your input or to misrepresent your work. Submitting unedited or minimally edited AI output as your own is considered academic dishonesty.\nIn professional contexts, you will be expected to present work that is authentically your own ‚Äî this course is practice for that.\n\nIf I suspect that the work that you have turned in is using AI, we will have to have a conversation to determine the next steps. Turning in AI work is considered plagiarism, and you may be asked to re-do the assignment, or possibly receive a 0 on the assignment. Your information may also be submitted to the university as a Breach of Academic Integrity.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to the safety of the RIT community and beyond. Because the situation is still in a rapid state of change, checking the RIT Ready website, and specifically the RIT Safety Plan for the most up to date information is recommended: https://www.rit.edu/ready/rit-safety-plan.\n\n\n\nI have provided this syllabus as a guide to our course and have made every attempt to provide an accurate overview of the course.

    "text": "Professor\nDustin Haraden, PhD\n\n\nEmail/Office\ndxhgsh@rit.edu; Eastman Hall - 3378\n\n\nOffice Hours\nWednesdays 9 - 11am or By Appointment\n\n\nClass Times\nMondays 8:00 - 10:50am\n\n\nClass Location\nWallace - 4640\n\n\n\nFor a PDF copy of the syllabus: Download File\n\n\nThis course is the introduction to statistics for graduate students. The goal of the course is to provide a grounding in statistical concepts, methods and application to research. I aim to increase student‚Äôs confidence in using these techniques and introducing them to R. Topics will range from including mathematical conceptualizations to practical application with various techniques ranging from descriptive statistics to regression.\n\n\n\n\nWe will be using R for all data wrangling, visualization, and analysis. You may use another statistical program in this course, but I will only be providing examples in R. Students must have the latest version of R and it is strongly recommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, both can be found here. Both types of software are free.\nWe will primarily be referring to chapters in the following textbooks:\n\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics (2e) (Cetinkaya-Rundel & Hardin, 2024)\nLearning Statistics with R (Navarro)\nR for Data Science (2e) (Wickham, √áetinkaya-Rundel, & Grolemund, 2023)\nModern Statistics with R (2e) (Thullin, 2025)\nStatistical Thinking (Poldrack, 2024)\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning (2e) (James, Witten, Hastie & Tibshirani, 2023)\nData Analysis: A Model Comparison Approach to Regression, ANOVA, and Beyond (3rd ed.) (Judd, McClelland, & Ryan, 2017)\n\nThese textbooks are available for free online and able to be downloaded. You may choose to purchase a paper copy if you wish, but it is not required.\nAll additional readings will be provided by the instructor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote: Readings on the schedule will need to be completed prior to the course they are listed for. We will build on the concepts you read about in that specific class period, so it is important that you have read.\n\n\n\nCourse Goals\n\nBuild confidence in statistical reasoning & analysis.\nApply regression-based methods to real-world research questions.\nDevelop practical R skills for data wrangling, visualization, and reporting.\nProduce a portfolio-ready, reproducible final analysis.\n\n\nEvaluation and Grading\nYour grade is a reflection of your consistent effort, active engagement with the material, and ability to apply new concepts. The components are designed to build on one another, leading to a comprehensive understanding of data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nWeight\n\n\nWeekly Labs\n30%\n\n\nJournal Entries\n10%\n\n\nParticipation & Engagement\n15%\n\n\nMidterm Project\n20%\n\n\nFinal Project\n25%\n\n\n\nWeekly Labs\nThese are hands-on R assignments that directly reinforce the concepts from the week‚Äôs class. They are your primary opportunity to practice coding, build models, and interpret results. Labs will be submitted as R Markdown files, and your lowest score will be dropped. Labs will be due the Sunday night (11:59pm) before the next class.\nJournal Entries\nEach week, you will submit a short, reflective journal entry. This is a space for metacognition‚Äîthinking about your own learning. Prompts will include questions like, ‚ÄúWhat was the clearest concept this week, and why did it click?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat was the ‚Äòmuddiest‚Äô point for you, and what question would you ask about it?‚Äù. They can also take the form of just a general reflection. I want to get to know you and your learning throughout this process. This can also include anything related to your personal life or mental health that you would like for me to know, such as whether you are struggling to balance classes and research, having trouble creating a workspace at home, or whether you can balance time spent on campus and off. This can also be completely random things, like a news article you can‚Äôt stop thinking about, or a favorite TV show, movie or book that you just love (especially if it is LOTR or Cosmere related). The content of what you write has no impact on your grade. In addition, what you write will be kept confidential.\nThe purpose of this ‚Äúassignment‚Äù is to help facilitate communication between you and me. I have found other instructors using this and I would like to be able to develop supportive relationships with students, so I decided to implement this. Other instructors reported that they found that many students were more comfortable discussing questions and concerns in their journal assignments rather than through email.\nIn-Class Engagement & Activities\nOur class is a workshop, and your active participation is key. This portion of your grade is earned by being present and engaged. This includes participating in group discussions, engaging with the readings, working with peers on problems, and completing the small, hands-on coding exercises we‚Äôll do together or in small groups in class. This is a low-stress grade based on your consistent effort and collaboration during our classes.\nMidterm Project\nThis is a comprehensive analysis of a dataset I will provide. You will be asked to clean and visualize the data, formulate a research question, build an appropriate regression model, check its assumptions, and write a concise report of your findings. This project assesses your mastery of the first half of the course and will be due before the first class after Fall Break.\nFinal Project\nFor your final project, you will choose a dataset (either your own research data or from a list of options), develop your own research questions, and conduct a full analysis from start to finish. You will present your work in a short, manuscript-style report and a brief ‚Äúlightning talk‚Äù to the class in our final meeting. This is your capstone assignment to demonstrate your independent data analysis skills.\nGrade Scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nA\nA-\nB+\nB\nB-\nC+\nC\nC-\nD\nF\n\n\n\n\nPercentage\n93+\n90-92\n87-89\n83-86\n80-82\n77-79\n73-76\n70-72\n60-69\n&lt;60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúA Wizard is never late, nor are they early. They arrive precisely when they mean to.‚Äù üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nThanks Gandalf. Super helpful. Unfortunately, we are not wizards and late penalties will be applied to work that is not on time. There will be a 15% deduction on the first day. And a 5% increase for each day beyond the deadline. Work will not be accepted beyond 5 days after the deadline.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing academic adjustments to students with disabilities. If you would like to request academic adjustments such as testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. Contact information for the DSO and information about how to request adjustments can be found at www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive academic adjustment approval, it is imperative that you contact me as early as possible so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.\n\n\n\nAs an instructor, I¬†have a mandatory reporting responsibility¬†as a part of¬†my role. It is my goal that you feel comfortable sharing information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to¬†report information I¬†receive¬†regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred during your time at RIT.¬†\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT‚Äôs policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT‚Äôs Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators when incidents are stated to them directly. The information you provide to a non-confidential resource which includes faculty will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek resolution. Even RIT Offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible.\nIf an individual discloses information during a public awareness event, a protest, during a class project, or advocacy event, RIT is not obligated to investigate based on this public disclosure. RIT may however use this information to further educate faculty, staff and students about prevention efforts and available resources.\nIf you would like to report an incident of gender based discrimination or harassment directly you may do so by using the online Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting or anonymously by using the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from any of RIT‚Äôs confidential resources (listed below).\n\nRIT Counseling and Psychological Services\n\n585-475-2261 (V)\n585-475-6897 (TTY)\nwww.rit.edu/counseling\n\nNTID Counseling and Academic Advising\n\n585-475-6400\nwww.ntid.rit.edu/counselingdept\n\nRIT Student Health Center\n\n585-475-2255 (V)\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/studenthealth\n\nCenter for Religious Life\n\n585-475-2137\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/religion\n\nRIT Ombuds Office\n\n585-475-7357\n585-475-6424\n585-286-4677 (VP)\nwww.rit.edu/ombuds/contact-us\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. The Department of Psychology encourages all students to become familiar with the RIT Honor Code and with RIT‚Äôs Academic Integrity Policy. RIT‚Äôs policy on academic integrity requires the instructor to investigate of any suspected breach of academic integrity. If the preponderance of evidence indicates a breach of academic integrity, the student who did so may incur a consequence up to and including failure for the entire course.\nAbout Generative AI\nYou may use generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, or CoPilot) as a support for your work in this course. However:\n\nYou must personally review, edit, and take ownership of all submitted work.\nAny use of AI must be acknowledged in a brief note at the end of the assignment (e.g., ‚ÄúI used ChatGPT to generate initial bullet points for my resume, which I then revised and expanded.‚Äù) as well as being properly cited (RIT Library Citation Infoguide)\nAI tools may not be used to generate entire assignments without your input or to misrepresent your work. Submitting unedited or minimally edited AI output as your own is considered academic dishonesty.\nIn professional contexts, you will be expected to present work that is authentically your own ‚Äî this course is practice for that.\n\nIf I suspect that the work that you have turned in is using AI, we will have to have a conversation to determine the next steps. Turning in AI work is considered plagiarism, and you may be asked to re-do the assignment, or possibly receive a 0 on the assignment. Your information may also be submitted to the university as a Breach of Academic Integrity.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to the safety of the RIT community and beyond. Because the situation is still in a rapid state of change, checking the RIT Ready website, and specifically the RIT Safety Plan for the most up to date information is recommended: https://www.rit.edu/ready/rit-safety-plan.\n\n\n\nI have provided this syllabus as a guide to our course and have made every attempt to provide an accurate overview of the course. However, as instructor, I reserve the right to modify this document during the semester, if necessary, to ensure that we achieve course learning objectives. You will receive advance notice of any changes to the syllabus through myCourses/email.",

    "text": "Course Plan\nThis is subject to change and instructor will inform the students as soon as possible.\n\nWeek 1 ‚Äî Getting Started with R & Tidy Data\n\nWe‚Äôll dive right into our primary tool, R. This session covers installing R and RStudio, navigating the interface, understanding R projects, and learning the foundational syntax of the R language and the tidyverse, including data types and basic functions.\n\nWeek 2 ‚Äî LABOR DAY (NO CLASS)\n\nContinue to develop skills and comfort in R. You will be provided with readings and other practice problems, and maybe a video lecture.\n\nWeek 3 ‚Äî Describing, Visualizing & Communicating\n\nWhat is in our data? We‚Äôll learn how to calculate descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) and master the ‚Äúgrammar of graphics‚Äù to create compelling, publication-quality plots with ggplot2. We will also introduce R Markdown for creating reproducible reports.\n\nWeek 4 ‚Äî Designing Studies & Sampling\n\nThis is a conceptual week focusing on the foundations of research. We‚Äôll discuss different research designs (experimental, correlational), sampling methods, the distinction between a sample and a population, and the fundamental logic of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST).\n\nWeek 5 ‚Äî Correlations & Effect Sizes\n\nWe‚Äôll quantify the relationship between two continuous variables using covariance and correlation. We will also introduce the concept of effect sizes as a standardized way to describe the magnitude of a relationship, moving beyond a simple ‚Äúyes/no‚Äù significance test. ‚ÄúHow strong is the association?‚Äù\n\nWeek 6 ‚Äî Comparing Groups\n\nWe‚Äôll explore classic methods for comparing group means, including independent and paired-samples t-tests. We‚Äôll conduct these tests in R and learn how to interpret their output. This will serve as our first formal hypothesis-testing tool.\n\nWeek 7 ‚Äî Building to Regression: Variability & Model Fit\n\nWe‚Äôll introduce the core logic of the General Linear Model by partitioning variance. Concepts like sums of squares will be introduced to help us understand how a model ‚Äúexplains‚Äù variance in an outcome variable. We will introduce R2 as a fundamental measure of model fit. ‚ÄúHow much of the outcome can we explain?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8 ‚Äî FALL BREAK (NO CLASS) üçÇ\n\n\n\nWeek 9 ‚Äî Simple Linear Regression\n\nThe formal introduction to the regression model: Yi‚Äã=Œ≤0‚Äã+Œ≤1‚ÄãXi‚Äã+œµi‚Äã. We will learn how to estimate the model‚Äôs parameters (intercept and slope), interpret their meaning, and assess overall model fit using the lm() function in R. ‚ÄúWhat is the exact formula for prediction?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nWeek 10 ‚Äî Multiple Regression I: Adding Predictors\n\nWe‚Äôll expand our model to include multiple continuous predictors. Key topics include interpreting partial slopes (the effect of one predictor while controlling for others), understanding adjusted R2, and identifying issues like multicollinearity.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 11 ‚Äî Multiple Regression II: Categorical Predictors\n\nHow do we include groups (e.g., experimental conditions) in our regression model? We‚Äôll learn about dummy coding and indicator variables. This is where we will explicitly demonstrate that t-tests and ANOVA are simply special cases of regression.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 12 ‚Äî Assumptions + Model Diagnostics\n\nIs our model trustworthy? We will learn how to check the assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, including linearity, normality of residuals, and homoscedasticity. We will use graphical methods in R to diagnose problems and discuss potential remedies.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 13 ‚Äî Expanding Regression\n\nTopics: We will explore ways to capture more complex relationships in our data. The primary focus will be on adding interaction terms to the model to test for moderation, but we may also touch on including non-linear relationships (e.g., quadratic terms) or talk about some mediation!\n\n\n\n\nWeek 14 ‚Äî Model Building + Comparison\n\nHow do we choose the best model? We will discuss practical strategies for building models, such as hierarchical regression, and learn how to use information criteria (like AIC and BIC) to compare different competing models.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 15 ‚Äî Making R work for you\n\nWe‚Äôve worked a whole lot with R, but what are some of the cool things that it can do. We will explore and organize what we have learned so far to solidify the use of R for reproducible workflows!\n\n\n\n\nWeek 16 ‚Äî Wrapping Up + Workshop\n\nThis final session will serve two purposes. First, it will be a dedicated workshop for you to get help and ask questions about your final projects. Second, we will have a course wrap-up, reviewing the major themes and discussing next steps for your statistical journey.",

Also, the RStudio interface looks the same for the various operating systems which will make teaching and your experience with the material a lot easier.\nRStudio (the company) has recently changed their name to Posit. To download RStudio, you can navigate to the Posit download page for ‚ÄúRStudio Desktop‚Äù. We have already completed Step 1 (you could have just come here to download it, but it is helpful to know where to get the latest versions and materials)! All you have to do is select the box under ‚Äú2: Install RStudio‚Äù to download. It should recognize the operating system that you are using, but if it does not, you will just need to scroll down the page to identify the appropriate installer.\nNow you are all set and ready to go!

Higher scores indicate greater sleepiness. NOTE: You will need to calculate a total score which is a sum of all 8 items.\nashs1 - ashs33: (Continuous) The student‚Äôs responses to each item on the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale. Higher scores indicate better sleep habits (e.g., consistent bedtime, quiet environment). NOTE: You will need to reverse score all items except¬†#27. You will also need to calculate a total mean score with these items.\nattention1r - attention5r: (Categorical) An indication of whether they passed (1) or failed (0) the attention check item.

By default, the describe() function forces non-numeric variables to be numeric and attempts to calculate descriptives for them. These variables are marked with an asterisk (*). In this case, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to calculate descriptive statistics for these variables, so we get a warning message and a bunch of NaN‚Äôs and NA‚Äôs for these variables.\nA better approach would be to remove non-numeric variables before you attempt to run numerical calculations on your dataset."
