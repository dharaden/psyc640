# Following Along

**Objective:** To examine the process of multiple linear regression. To produce a reproducible workflow.

## Collect the Data

**First**, go to the LEGO website and identify a set that you like. Navigate to this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfR3myKgXz7yoi-S6ro1wLIpdh8F5n2BB_l627eDnVx7tTiwQ/viewform?usp=header){target="_blank"} and submit the following information:

-   Name of the Set

-   Set Number

-   \# of Pieces

-   Price

## Inspect Data

Next, we inspect the data and check the descriptives.

## Visualize

Now we can create a scatterplot between our variables of interest.

## Run the Model

Finally, we create the model and interpret the output.

## ❓Questions

1.  Given our model, how much would a set with 1,031 pieces cost?
2.  Next year, a new set is expected to be released that has 250 pieces and cost \$99. Where would this fit into our figure? What could explain this deviation from our model?

# On Your Own

<a href="/files/data/CAH.csv" download="CAH.csv">Download Week 10 Class ActivityFollow Along (.csv)</a>

Data is taken from [Cards Against Humanity - Pulse of the Nation](https://thepulseofthenation.com/#future){target="_blank"}

Download the data and move it to the correct folder so that you can access it in this activity.

Import the data into your R file.

Focus on having reproducible code! You will share your file with someone else. They should be able to run it.

## Steps:

1.  Import Data
2.  Check descriptive statistics
3.  Create a correlation plot for the continuous variables
4.  Visualize the relationship between \# of Transformers Movies and Books
5.  Conduct a multiple linear regression with 2 variables that you've chosen (and why you might have chosen them) to predict \# of Transformers Movies.
6.  Briefly report the results

### Items in the Data:

| ethnicity | What is your race? |
| marrital status | What is your marital status? |
| climate change | Do you believe that climate change is real and caused by people, real but not caused by people, or not real at all? |
| Transformers | How many Transformers movies have you seen?  |
| books | How many books, if any, have you read in the past year? |
| ghosts | Do you believe in ghosts? |
| spending | Is federal funding of scientific research too high, too low, or about right? |
| choice | If you had to choose: would you rather be smart and sad, or dumb and happy? |
| shower_pee | Do you think it is acceptable or unacceptable to urinate in the shower? |
