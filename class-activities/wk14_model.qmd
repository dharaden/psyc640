Re: Data Analysis Request

Our research team has collected longitudinal data on 400 adolescents (Variables described in the **Data Dictionary** ). We have cleaned the data, but we are unsure which relationships are significant. Since you haven't looked at the data, please think about what may be a relevant question to investigate. Once you have that question, we will approve it and then you can perform your data analysis followed by a "report" back to us.

Thank you,

Dr. E. Brown

## Data Dictionary

|                     |                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Variable Prefix** | **Meaning**                 |
| **T1\_**            | Time 1 (Baseline, Ages 7-9) |
| **T2\_**            | Time 2 (1 Year Later)       |
| **T3\_**            | Time 3 (2 Years Later)      |

|                   |                          |                             |
|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Variable Name** | **Description**          | **Scale**                   |
| `ID`              | Participant ID           | 1-400                       |
| `Sex`             | Biological Sex           | 0=Male, 1=Female            |
| `SES`             | Socioeconomic Status     | Z-score (0=Avg, High=Rich)  |
| `Age`             | Age in years             | Continuous                  |
| `Puberty`         | Pubertal Development     | 0-8 (0=Child, 8=Adult)      |
| `SleepDur`        | Objective Sleep Duration | Hours (e.g., 9.5)           |
| `SleepQual`       | Subjective Sleep Quality | 0-20 (**High = BAD sleep**) |
| `PeerStress`      | Social Stress            | 0-20 (High = Stressed)      |
| `AcadStress`      | School Stress            | 0-20 (High = Stressed)      |
| `Dep`             | Depression Symptoms      | 0-60 (High = Depressed)     |
| `Anx`             | Anxiety Symptoms         | 0-21 (High = Anxious)       |

## Potential Questions

Below are some questions that we may explore if we have time.

-   **Q1 (The "Socio-Economic Sleep Gap"):** Does Socioeconomic Status (SES) predict better objective sleep duration (`SleepDur`) at Baseline (T1)?

-   **Q2 (The "Stress Source" Debate):** At Age 10 (T2), which is the stronger predictor of Anxiety: `PeerStress` or `AcadStress`?

-   **Q3 (The "Puberty Effect"):** Does advanced Puberty status (`T1_Puberty`) predict lower sleep duration (`T1_SleepDur`), even when controlling for `T1_Age`?

-   **Q4 (The "Anxiety Trap"):** Does Academic Stress (`AcadStress`) lead to Depression (`Dep`) because it increases Anxiety (`Anx`)? (Analyze at T1 or T2).

-   **Q5 (The Original Hypothesis):** Does Poor Sleep Duration at T1 lead to Depression at T3 via the mechanism of Peer Stress at T2?

-   **Q6 (The "Gendered Buffer"):** Does the relationship between Academic Stress (`T2_AcadStress`) and Depression (`T3_Dep`) depend on the child's Sex? (e.g., Are girls more affected by academic stress?)

-   **Q7 (The "Biological Sensitizer"):** Does Puberty (`T2_Puberty`) amplify the effect of Peer Stress (`T2_PeerStress`) on Depression (`T3_Dep`)?
