We are almost at the end of the course! This week, we will be focusing on some random things related to R that could make things easier. Plus, there will be time for working on your final project, helping your peers and "office hours".

## Data for Today

We may have a demo of a workflow. In that case, we will be able to pick some data from this website below. I think the DASS (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale) dataset would be a good candidate.

Here is the RMD file that I worked on in class today for you to review if needed
